When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers
stretch out, seeking Prim’s warmth but finding only the
rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad
dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did.
This is the day of the reaping.
I prop myself up on one elbow. There’s enough light in the
bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her
side, cocooned in my mother’s body, their cheeks pressed together.
In sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not
so beaten-down. Prim’s face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely
as the primrose for which she was named. My mother was
very beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me.
Sitting at Prim’s knees, guarding her, is the world’s ugliest
cat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the color of
rotting squash. Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his
muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower. I le hates me.
Or at least distrusts me. Even though it was years ago, I think
he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when
Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly swollen with
worms, crawling with fleas. The last thing I needed was
another mouth to feed. But Prim begged so hard, cried even, I
had to let him stay. It turned out okay. My mother got rid of
the vermin and he’s a born mouser. Even catches the occasional
rat. Sometimes, when I clean a kill, I feed Buttercup the
entrails. He has stopped hissing at me.
Entrails. No hissing. This is the closest we will ever come to
love.
I swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots.
Supple leather that has molded to my feet. I pull on trousers, a
shirt, tuck my long dark braid up into a cap, and grab my forage
bag. On the table, under a wooden bowl to protect it from
hungry rats and cats alike, sits a perfect little goat cheese
wrapped in basil leaves. Prim’s gift to me on reaping day. I put
the cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip outside.
Our part of District 12, nicknamed the Seam, is usually
crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at
this hour. Men and women with hunched shoulders, swollen
knuckles, many who have long since stopped trying to scrub
the coal dust out of their broken nails, the lines of their sunken
faces. But today the black cinder streets are empty. Shutters
on the squat gray houses are closed. The reaping isn’t until
two. May as well sleep in. If you can.
Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam. I only have to
pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow.
Separating the Meadow from the woods, in fact enclosing all
of District 12, is a high chain-link fence topped with barbedwire
loops. In theory, it’s supposed to be electrified twentyfour
hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the
woods — packs of wild dogs, lone cougars, bears — that used
to threaten our streets. But since we’re lucky to get two or
three hours of electricity in the evenings, it’s usually safe to
touch. Even so, I always take a moment to listen carefully for
the hum that means the fence is live. Right now, it’s silent as a
stone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out on my belly
and slide under a two-foot stretch that’s been loose for
years. There are several other weak spots in the fence, but this
one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here.
As soon as I’m in the trees, I retrieve a bow and sheath of
arrows from a hollow log. Electrified or not, the fence has
been successful at keeping the flesh-eaters out of District 12.
Inside the woods they roam freely, and there are added concerns
like venomous snakes, rabid animals, and no real paths
to follow. But there’s also food if you know how to find it. My
father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to
bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing even to bury. I
was eleven then. Five years later, I still wake up screaming for
him to run.
Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching
carries the severest of penalties, more people would risk it
if they had weapons. But most are not bold enough to venture
out with just a knife. My bow is a rarity, crafted by my father
along with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods,
carefully wrapped in waterproof covers. My father could have
made good money selling them, but if the officials found out
he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion.
Most of the Peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who
hunt because they’re as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is.
In fact, they’re among our best customers. But the idea that
someone might be arming the Seam would never have been
allowed.
In the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest
apples. But always in sight of the Meadow. Always close
enough to run back to the safety of District 12 if trouble arises.
District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety, I
mutter. Then I glance quickly over my shoulder. Even here,
even in the middle of nowhere, you worry someone might
overhear you.
When I was younger, I scared my mother to death, the
things I would blurt out about District 12, about the people
who rule our country, Panem, from the far-off city called the
Capitol. Eventually I understood this would only lead us to
more trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my
features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever
read my thoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only
polite small talk in the public market. Discuss little more than
trades in the Hob, which is the black market where I make
most of my money. Even at home, where I am less pleasant, I
avoid discussing tricky topics. Like the reaping, or food shortages,
or the Hunger Games. Prim might begin to repeat my
words and then where would we be?
In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be
myself. Gale. I can feel the muscles in my face relaxing, my
pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place, a rock ledge
overlooking a valley. A thicket of berry bushes protects it from
unwanted eyes. The sight of him waiting there brings on a
smile. Gale says I never smile except in the woods.
Hey, Catnip, says Gale. My real name is Katniss, but when
I first told him, I had barely whispered it. So he thought I’d
said Catnip. Then when this crazy lynx started following me
around the woods looking for handouts, it became his official
nickname for me. I finally had to kill the lynx because he
scared off game. I almost regretted it because he wasn’t bad
company. But I got a decent price for his pelt.
Look what I shot, Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow
stuck in it, and I laugh. It’s real bakery bread, not the flat,
dense loaves we make from our grain rations. I take it in my
hands, pull out the arrow, and hold the puncture in the crust
to my nose, inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood
with saliva. Fine bread like this is for special occasions.
Mm, still warm, I say. He must have been at the bakery at
the crack of dawn to trade for it. What did it cost you?
Just a squirrel. Think the old man was feeling sentimental
this morning, says Gale. Even wished me luck.
Well, we all feel a little closer today, don’t we? I say, not
even bothering to roll my eyes. Prim left us a cheese. I pull it
out.
His expression brightens at the treat. Thank you, Prim.
We’ll have a real feast. Suddenly he falls into a Capitol accent
as he mimics Effie Trinket, the maniacally upbeat woman who
arrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping. I almost
forgot! Happy Hunger Games! He plucks a few blackberries
from the bushes around us. And may the odds — He
tosses a berry in a high arc toward me.
I catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my
teeth. The sweet tartness explodes across my tongue. — be
ever in your favor! I finish with equal verve. We have to joke
about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your
wits. Besides, the Capitol accent is so affected, almost anything
sounds funny in it.
I watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread. He
could be my brother. Straight black hair, olive skin, we even
have the same gray eyes. But we’re not related, at least not
closely. Most of the families who work the mines resemble
one another this way.
That’s why my mother and Prim, with their light hair and
blue eyes, always look out of place. They are. My mother’s
parents were part of the small merchant class that caters to
officials, Peacekeepers, and the occasional Seam customer.
They ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of District 12.
Since almost no one can afford doctors, apothecaries are our
healers. My father got to know my mother because on his
hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell
them to her shop to be brewed into remedies. She must have
really loved him to leave her home for the Seam. I try to remember
that when all I can see is the woman who sat by,
blank and unreachable, while her children turned to skin and
bones. I try to forgive her for my father’s sake. But to be honest,
I’m not the forgiving type.
Gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese,
carefully placing a basil leaf on each while I strip the bushes of
their berries. We settle back in a nook in the rocks. From this
place, we are invisible but have a clear view of the valley,
which is teeming with summer life, greens to gather, roots to
dig, fish iridescent in the sunlight. The day is glorious, with a
blue sky and soft breeze. The food’s wonderful, with the
cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting
in our mouths. Everything would be perfect if this really was a
holiday, if all the day off meant was roaming the mountains
with Gale, hunting for tonight’s supper. But instead we have to
be standing in the square at two o’clock waiting for the names
to be called out.
We could do it, you know, Gale says quietly.
What? I ask.
Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we
could make it, says Gale.
I don’t know how to respond. The idea is so preposterous.
If we didn’t have so many kids, he adds quickly.
They’re not our kids, of course. But they might as well be.
Gale’s two little brothers and a sister. Prim. And you may as
well throw in our mothers, too, because how would they live
without us? Who would fill those mouths that are always asking
for more? With both of us hunting daily, there are still
nights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or
wool, still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs growling.
I never want to have kids, I say.
I might. If I didn’t live here, says Gale.
But you do, I say, irritated.
Forget it, he snaps back.
The conversation feels all wrong. Leave? How could I leave
Prim, who is the only person in the world I’m certain I love?
And Gale is devoted to his family. We can’t leave, so why bother
talking about it? And even if we did . . . even if we did . . .
where did this stuff about having kids come from? There’s
never been anything romantic between Gale and me. When we
met, I was a skinny twelve-year-old, and although he was only
two years older, he already looked like a man. It took a long
time for us to even become friends, to stop haggling over
every trade and begin helping each other out.
Besides, if he wants kids, Gale won’t have any trouble finding
a wife. He’s good-looking, he’s strong enough to handle the
work in the mines, and he can hunt. You can tell by the way
the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that
they want him. It makes me jealous but not for the reason
people would think. Good hunting partners are hard to find.
What do you want to do? I ask. We can hunt, fish, or gather.
Let’s fish at the lake. We can leave our poles and gather in
the woods. Get something nice for tonight, he says.
Tonight. After the reaping, everyone is supposed to celebrate.
And a lot of people do, out of relief that their children
have been spared for another year. But at least two families
will pull their shutters, lock their doors, and try to figure out
how they will survive the painful weeks to come.
We make out well. The predators ignore us on a day when
easier, tastier prey abounds. By late morning, we have a dozen
fish, a bag of greens and, best of all, a gallon of strawberries. I
found the patch a few years ago, but Gale had the idea to
string mesh nets around it to keep out the animals.
On the way home, we swing by the Hob, the black market
that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal.
When they came up with a more efficient system that transported
the coal directly from the mines to the trains, the Hob
gradually took over the space. Most businesses are closed by
this time on reaping day, but the black market’s still fairly
busy. We easily trade six of the fish for good bread, the other
two for salt. Greasy Sae, the bony old woman who sells bowls
of hot soup from a large kettle, takes half the greens off our
hands in exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin. We
might do a tad better elsewhere, but we make an effort to
keep on good terms with Greasy Sae. She’s the only one who
can consistently be counted on to buy wild dog. We don’t hunt
them on purpose, but if you’re attacked and you take out a dog
or two, well, meat is meat. Once it’s in the soup, I’ll call it
beef, Greasy Sae says with a wink. No one in the Seam would
turn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog, but the Peacekeepers
who come to the Hob can afford to be a little choosier.
When we finish our business at the market, we go to the
back door of the mayor’s house to sell half the strawberries,
knowing he has a particular fondness for them and can afford
our price. The mayor’s daughter, Madge, opens the door. She’s
in my year at school. Being the mayor’s daughter, you’d expect
her to be a snob, but she’s all right. She just keeps to herself.
Like me. Since neither of us really has a group of friends, we
seem to end up together a lot at school. Eating lunch, sitting
next to each other at assemblies, partnering for sports activities.
We rarely talk, which suits us both just fine.
Today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an expensive
white dress, and her blonde hair is done up with a
pink ribbon. Reaping clothes.
Pretty dress, says Gale.
Madge shoots him a look, trying to see if it’s a genuine
compliment or if he’s just being ironic. It is a pretty dress, but
she would never be wearing it ordinarily. She presses her lips
together and then smiles. Well, if I end up going to the Capitol,
I want to look nice, don’t I?
Now it’s Gale’s turn to be confused. Does she mean it? Or is
she messing with him? I’m guessing the second.
You won’t be going to the Capitol, says Gale coolly. His
eyes land on a small, circular pin that adorns her dress. Real
gold. Beautifully crafted. It could keep a family in bread for
months. What can you have? Five entries? I had six when I
was just twelve years old.
That’s not her fault, I say.
No, it’s no one’s fault. Just the way it is, says Gale. Madge’s
face has become closed off. She puts the money for the berries
in my hand. Good luck, Katniss. You, too, I say, and the
door closes.
We walk toward the Seam in silence. I don’t like that Gale
took a dig at Madge, but he’s right, of course. The reaping system
is unfair, with the poor getting the worst of it. You become
eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve. That
year, your name is entered once. At thirteen, twice. And so on
and so on until you reach the age of eighteen, the final year of
eligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven times.
That’s true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire
country of Panem.
But here’s the catch. Say you are poor and starving as we
were. You can opt to add your name more times in exchange
for tesserae. Each tessera is worth a meager year’s supply of
grain and oil for one person. You may do this for each of your
family members as well. So, at the age of twelve, I had my
name entered four times. Once, because I had to, and three
times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my
mother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. And the
entries are cumulative. So now, at the age of sixteen, my name
will be in the reaping twenty times. Gale, who is eighteen and
has been either helping or single-handedly feeding a family of
five for seven years, will have his name in forty-two times.
You can see why someone like Madge, who has never been
at risk of needing a tessera, can set him off. The chance of her
name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who
live in the Seam. Not impossible, but slim. And even though
the rules were set up by the Capitol, not the districts, certainly
not Madge’s family, it’s hard not to resent those who don’t
have to sign up for tesserae.
Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On other
days, deep in the woods, I’ve listened to him rant about how
the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district.
A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of
the Seam and those who can generally count on supper and
thereby ensure we will never trust one another. It’s to the
Capitol’s advantage to have us divided among ourselves, he
might say if there were no ears to hear but mine. If it wasn’t
reaping day. If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not
made what I’m sure she thought was a harmless comment.
As we walk, I glance over at Gale’s face, still smoldering underneath
his stony expression. His rages seem pointless to me,
although I never say so. It’s not that I don’t agree with him. I
do. But what good is yelling about the Capitol in the middle of
the woods? It doesn’t change anything. It doesn’t make things
fair. It doesn’t fill our stomachs. In fact, it scares off the nearby
game. I let him yell though. Better he does it in the woods than
in the district.
Gale and I divide our spoils, leaving two fish, a couple of
loaves of good bread, greens, a quart of strawberries, salt, paraffin,
and a bit of money for each.
See you in the square, I say.
Wear something pretty, he says flatly.
At home, I find my mother and sister are ready to go. My
mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary days. Prim is
in my first reaping outfit, a skirt and ruffled blouse. It’s a bit
big on her, but my mother has made it stay with pins. Even so,
she’s having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back.
A tub of warm water waits for me. I scrub off the dirt and
sweat from the woods and even wash my hair. To my surprise,
my mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me.
A soft blue thing with matching shoes.
Are you sure? I ask. I’m trying to get past rejecting offers
of help from her. For a while, I was so angry, I wouldn’t allow
her to do anything for me. And this is something special. Her
clothes from her past are very precious to her.
Of course. Let’s put your hair up, too, she says. I let her
towel-dry it and braid it up on my head. I can hardly recognize
myself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall.
You look beautiful, says Prim in a hushed voice.
And nothing like myself, I say. I hug her, because I know
these next few hours will be terrible for her. Her first reaping.
She’s about as safe as you can get, since she’s only entered
once. I wouldn’t let her take out any tesserae. But she’s worried
about me. That the unthinkable might happen.
I protect Prim in every way I can, but I’m powerless against
the reaping. The anguish I always feel when she’s in pain wells
up in my chest and threatens to register on my (ace. I notice
her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and
force myself to stay calm. Tuck your tail in, little duck, I say,
smoothing the blouse back in place.
Prim giggles and gives me a small Quack.
Quack yourself, I say with a light laugh. The kind only
Prim can draw out of me. Come on, let’s eat, I say and plant a
quick kiss on the top of her head.
The fish and greens are already cooking in a stew, but that
will be for supper. We decide to save the strawberries and bakery
bread for this evening’s meal, to make it special we say.
Instead we drink milk from Prim’s goat, Lady, and eat the
rough bread made from the tessera grain, although no one has
much appetite anyway.
At one o’clock, we head for the square. Attendance is mandatory
unless you are on death’s door. This evening, officials
will come around and check to see if this is the case. If not,
you’ll be imprisoned.
It’s too bad, really, that they hold the reaping in the square
— one of the few places in District 12 that can be pleasant.
The square’s surrounded by shops, and on public market days,
especially if there’s good weather, it has a holiday feel to it.
But today, despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings,
there’s an air of grimness. The camera crews, perched
like buzzards on rooftops, only add to the effect.
People file in silently and sign in. The reaping is a good opportunity
for the Capitol to keep tabs on the population as
well. Twelve- through eighteen-year-olds are herded into
roped areas marked off by ages, the oldest in the front, the
young ones, like Prim, toward the back. Family members line
up around the perimeter, holding tightly to one another’s
hands. But there are others, too, who have no one they love at
stake, or who no longer care, who slip among the crowd, taking
bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn. Odds are
given on their ages, whether they’re Seam or merchant, if they
will break down and weep. Most refuse dealing with the racketeers
but carefully, carefully. These same people tend to be
informers, and who hasn’t broken the law? I could be shot on
a daily basis for hunting, but the appetites of those in charge
protect me. Not everyone can claim the same.
Anyway, Gale and I agree that if we have to choose between
dying of hunger and a bullet in the head, the bullet would be
much quicker.
The space gets tighter, more claustrophobic as people arrive.
The square’s quite large, but not enough to hold District
12’s population of about eight thousand. Latecomers are directed
to the adjacent streets, where they can watch the event
on screens as it’s televised live by the state.
I find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the Seam.
We all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the
temporary stage that is set up before the Justice Building. It
holds three chairs, a podium, and two large glass balls, one for
the boys and one for the girls. I stare at the paper slips in the
girls’ ball. Twenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on
them in careful handwriting.
Two of the three chairs fill with Madge’s father, Mayor Undersee,
who’s a tall, balding man, and Effie Trinket, District
12’s escort, fresh from the Capitol with her scary white grin,
pinkish hair, and spring green suit. They murmur to each other
and then look with concern at the empty seat.
Just as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to
the podium and begins to read. It’s the same story every year.
He tells of the history of Panem, the country that rose up out
of the ashes of a place that was once called North America. He
lists the disasters, the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching
seas that swallowed up so much of the land, the
brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The result was
Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts, which
brought peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the
Dark Days, the uprising of the districts against the Capitol.
Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty
of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and, as
our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated,
it gave us the Hunger Games.
The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment
for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one
girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twentyfour
tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that
could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland.
Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must
fight to the death. The last tribute standing wins.
Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one
another while we watch — this is the Capitol’s way of reminding
us how totally we are at their mercy. How little chance we
would stand of surviving another rebellion.
Whatever words they use, the real message is clear. Look
how we take your children and sacrifice them and there’s
nothing you can do. If you lift a finger, we will destroy every
last one of you. Just as we did in District Thirteen.
To make it humiliating as well as torturous, the Capitol requires
us to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity, a sporting
event pitting every district against the others. The last tribute
alive receives a life of ease back home, and their district will
be showered with prizes, largely consisting of food. All year,
the Capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil
and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle starvation.
It is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks, intones
the mayor.
Then he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In seventyfour
years, we have had exactly two. Only one is still alive.
Haymitch Abernathy, a paunchy, middle-aged man, who at
this moment appears hollering something unintelligible, staggers
onto the stage, and falls into the third chair. He’s drunk.
Very. The crowd responds with its token applause, but he’s
confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she
barely manages to fend off.
The mayor looks distressed. Since all of this is being televised,
right now District 12 is the laughingstock of Panem, and
he knows it. He quickly tries to pull the attention back to the
reaping by introducing Effie Trinket.
Bright and bubbly as ever, Effie Trinket trots to the podium
and gives her signature, Happy Hunger Games! And may the
odds be ever in your favor! Her pink hair must be a wig because
her curls have shifted slightly off-center since her encounter
with Haymitch. She goes on a bit about what an honor
it is to be here, although everyone knows she’s just aching to
get bumped up to a better district where they have proper victors,
not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation.
Through the crowd, I spot Gale looking back at me with a
ghost of a smile. As reapings go, this one at least has a slight
entertainment factor. But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and
his forty-two names in that big glass ball and how the odds
are not in his favor. Not compared to a lot of the boys. And
maybe he’s thinking the same thing about me because his face
darkens and he turns away. But there are still thousands of
slips, I wish I could whisper to him.
It’s time for the drawing. Effie Trinket says as she always
does, Ladies first! and crosses to the glass ball with the girls’
names. She reaches in, digs her hand deep into the ball, and
pulls out a slip of paper. The crowd draws in a collective
breath and then you can hear a pin drop, and I’m feeling nauseous
and so desperately hoping that it’s not me, that it’s not
me, that it’s not me.
Effie Trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes the slip
of paper, and reads out the name in a clear voice. And it’s not
me.
It’s Primrose Everdeen.
One time, when I was in a blind in a tree, waiting motionless
for game to wander by, I dozed off and fell ten feet to the
ground, landing on my back. It was as if the impact had
knocked every wisp of air from my lungs, and I lay there
struggling to inhale, to exhale, to do anything.
That’s how I feel now, trying to remember how to breathe,
unable to speak, totally stunned as the name bounces around
the inside of my skull. Someone is gripping my arm, a boy
from the Seam, and I think maybe I started to fall and he
caught me.
There must have been some mistake. This can’t be happening.
Prim was one slip of paper in thousands! Her chances
of being chosen so remote that I’d not even bothered to worry
about her. Hadn’t I done everything? Taken the tesserae, refused
to let her do the same? One slip. One slip in thousands.
The odds had been entirely in her favor. But it hadn’t mattered.
Somewhere far away, I can hear the crowd murmuring unhappily
as they always do when a twelve-year-old gets chosen
because no one thinks this is fair. And then I see her, the blood
drained from her face, hands clenched in fists at her sides,
walking with stiff, small steps up toward the stage, passing
me, and I see the back of her blouse has become untucked and
hangs out over her skirt. It’s this detail, the untucked blouse
forming a ducktail, that brings me back to myself.
Prim! The strangled cry comes out of my throat, and my
muscles begin to move again. Prim! I don’t need to shove
through the crowd. The other kids make way immediately allowing
me a straight path to the stage. I reach her just as she is
about to mount the steps. With one sweep of my arm, I push
her behind me.
I volunteer! I gasp. I volunteer as tribute!
There’s some confusion on the stage. District 12 hasn’t had
a volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty. The
rule is that once a tribute’s name has been pulled from the
ball, another eligible boy, if a boy’s name has been read, or
girl, if a girl’s name has been read, can step forward to take his
or her place. In some districts, in which winning the reaping is
such a great honor, people are eager to risk their lives, the volunteering
is complicated. But in District 12, where the word
tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse, volunteers
are all but extinct.
Lovely! says Effie Trinket. But I believe there’s a small
matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for
volunteers, and if one does come forth then we, um . . . she
trails off, unsure herself.
What does it matter? says the mayor. He’s looking at me
with a pained expression on his face. He doesn’t know me really,
but there’s a faint recognition there. I am the girl who
brings the strawberries. The girl his daughter might have spo-
ken of on occasion. The girl who five years ago stood huddled
with her mother and sister, as he presented her, the oldest
child, with a medal of valor. A medal for her father, vaporized
in the mines. Does he remember that? What does it matter?
he repeats gruffly. Let her come forward.
Prim is screaming hysterically behind me. She’s wrapped
her skinny arms around me like a vice. No, Katniss! No! You
can’t go!
Prim, let go, I say harshly, because this is upsetting me
and I don’t want to cry. When they televise the replay of the
reapings tonight, everyone will make note of my tears, and I’ll
be marked as an easy target. A weakling. I will give no one
that satisfaction. Let go!
I can feel someone pulling her from my back. I turn and see
Gale has lifted Prim off the ground and she’s thrashing in his
arms. Up you go, Catnip, he says, in a voice he’s fighting to
keep steady, and then he carries Prim off toward my mother. I
steel myself and climb the steps.
Well, bravo! gushes Effie Trinket. That’s the spirit of the
Games! She’s pleased to finally have a district with a little action
going on in it. What’s your name?
I swallow hard. Katniss Everdeen, I say.
I bet my buttons that was your sister. Don’t want her to
steal all the glory, do we? Come on, everybody! Let’s give a big
round of applause to our newest tribute! trills Effie Trinket.
To the everlasting credit of the people of District 12, not
one person claps. Not even the ones holding betting slips, the
ones who are usually beyond caring. Possibly because they
know me from the Hob, or knew my father, or have encountered
Prim, who no one can help loving. So instead of acknowledging
applause, I stand there unmoving while they
take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage. Silence.
Which says we do not agree. We do not condone. All of
this is wrong.
Then something unexpected happens. At least, I don’t expect
it because I don’t think of District 12 as a place that cares
about me. But a shift has occurred since I stepped up to take
Prim’s place, and now it seems I have become someone precious.
At first one, then another, then almost every member of
the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand
to their lips and holds it out to me. It is an old and rarely used
gesture of our district, occasionally seen at funerals. It means
thanks, it means admiration, it means good-bye to someone
you love.
Now I am truly in danger of crying, but fortunately Haymitch
chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to
congratulate me. Look at her. Look at this one! he hollers,
throwing an arm around my shoulders. He’s surprisingly
strong for such a wreck. I like her! His breath reeks of liquor
and it’s been a long time since he’s bathed. Lots of . . .  He
can’t think of the word for a while. Spunk! he says triumphantly.
More than you! he releases me and starts for the
front of the stage. More than you! he shouts, pointing directly
into a camera.
Is he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually
be taunting the Capitol? I’ll never know because just as
he’s opening his mouth to continue, Haymitch plummets off
the stage and knocks himself unconscious.
He’s disgusting, but I’m grateful. With every camera gleefully
trained on him, I have just enough time to release the small,
choked sound in my throat and compose myself. I put my
hands behind my back and stare into the distance.
I can see the hills I climbed this morning with Gale. For a
moment, I yearn for something . . . the idea of us leaving the
district . . . making our way in the woods . . . but I know I was
right about not running off. Because who else would have volunteered
for Prim?
Haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher, and Effie Trinket
is trying to get the ball rolling again. What an exciting day!
she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig, which has
listed severely to the right. But more excitement to come! It’s
time to choose our boy tribute! Clearly hoping to contain her
tenuous hair situation, she plants one hand on her head as she
crosses to the ball that contains the boys’ names and grabs the
first slip she encounters. She zips back to the podium, and I
don’t even have time to wish for Gale’s safety when she’s reading
the name. Peeta Mellark.
Peeta Mellark!
Oh, no, I think. Not him. Because I recognize this name, although
I have never spoken directly to its owner. Peeta Mellark.
No, the odds are not in my favor today. I watch him as he
makes his way toward the stage. Medium height, stocky build,
ashy blond hair that falls in waves over
his forehead. The shock of the moment is registering on his
face, you can see his struggle to remain emotionless, but his
blue eyes show the alarm I’ve seen so often in prey. Yet he
climbs steadily onto the stage and takes his place.
Effie Trinket asks for volunteers, but no one steps forward.
He has two older brothers, I know, I’ve seen them in the bakery,
but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the
other won’t. This is standard. Family devotion only goes so far
for most people on reaping day. What I did was the radical
thing.
The mayor begins to read the long, dull Treaty of Treason
as he does every year at this point — it’s required — but I’m
not listening to a word.
Why him? I think. Then I try to convince myself it doesn’t
matter. Peeta Mellark and I are not friends. Not even neighbors.
We don’t speak. Our only real interaction happened
years ago. He’s probably forgotten it. But I haven’t and I know
I never will. . . .
It was during the worst time. My father had been killed in
the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest January
anyone could remember. The numbness of his loss had
passed, and the pain would hit me out of nowhere, doubling
me over, racking my body with sobs. Where are you? I would
cry out in my mind. Where have you gone? Of course, there
was never any answer.
The district had given us a small amount of money as compensation
for his death, enough to cover one month of grieving
at which time my mother would be expected to get a job.
Only she didn’t. She didn’t do anything but sit propped up in a
chair or, more often, huddled under the blankets on her bed,
eyes fixed on some point in the distance. Once in a while, she’d
stir, get up as if moved by some urgent purpose, only to then
collapse back into stillness. No amount of pleading from Prim
seemed to affect her.
I was terrified. I suppose now that my mother was locked
in some dark world of sadness, but at the time, all I knew was
that I had lost not only a father, but a mother as well. At eleven
years old, with Prim just seven, I took over as head of the
family. There was no choice. I bought our food at the market
and cooked it as best I could and tried to keep Prim and myself
looking presentable. Because if it had become known that
my mother could no longer care for us, the district would have
taken us away from her and placed us in the community
home. I’d grown up seeing those home kids at school. The
sadness, the marks of angry hands on their faces, the hopelessness
that curled their shoulders forward. I could never let
that happen to Prim. Sweet, tiny Prim who cried when I cried
before she even knew the reason, who brushed and plaited my
mother’s hair before we left for school, who still polished my
father’s shaving mirror each night because he’d hated the
layer of coal dust that settled on everything in the Seam. The
community home would crush her like a bug. So I kept our
predicament a secret.
But the money ran out and we were slowly starving to
death. There’s no other way to put it. I kept telling myself if I
could only hold out until May, just May 8th, I would turn
twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that
precious grain and oil to feed us. Only there were still several
weeks to go. We could well be dead by then.
Starvation’s not an uncommon fate in District 12. Who
hasn’t seen the victims? Older people who can’t work. Children
from a family with too many to feed. Those injured in the
mines. Straggling through the streets. And one day, you come
upon them sitting motionless against a wall or lying in the
Meadow, you hear the wails from a house, and the Peacekeepers
are called in to retrieve the body. Starvation is never the
cause of death officially. It’s always the flu, or exposure, or
pneumonia. But that fools no one.
On the afternoon of my encounter with Peeta Mellark, the
rain was falling in relentless icy sheets. I had been in town,
trying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of Prim’s in
the public market, but there were no takers. Although I had
been to the Hob on several occasions with my father, I was too
frightened to venture into that rough, gritty place alone. The
rain had soaked through my father’s hunting jacket, leaving
me chilled to the bone. For three days, we’d had nothing but
boiled water with some old dried mint leaves I’d found in the
back of a cupboard. By the time the market closed, I was shaking
so hard I dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud
puddle. I didn’t pick it up for fear I would keel over and be unable
to regain my feet. Besides, no one wanted those clothes.
I couldn’t go home. Because at home was my mother with
her dead eyes and my little sister, with her hollow cheeks and
cracked lips. I couldn’t walk into that room with the smoky
fire from the damp branches I had scavenged at the edge of
the woods after the coal had run out, my bands empty of any
hope.
I found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the
shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople. The merchants
live above their businesses, so I was essentially in their backyards.
I remember the outlines of garden beds not yet planted
for the spring, a goat or two in a pen, one sodden dog tied to a
post, hunched defeated in the muck.
All forms of stealing are forbidden in District 12. Punishable
by death. But it crossed my mind that there might be
something in the trash bins, and those were fair game. Perhaps
a bone at the butcher’s or rotted vegetables at the grocer’s,
something no one but my family was desperate enough to
eat. Unfortunately, the bins had just been emptied.
When I passed the baker’s, the smell of fresh bread was so
overwhelming I felt dizzy. The ovens were in the back, and a
golden glow spilled out the open kitchen door. I stood mesmerized
by the heat and the luscious scent until the rain interfered,
running its icy fingers down my back, forcing me back
to life. I lifted the lid to the baker’s trash bin and found it spotlessly,
heartlessly bare.
Suddenly a voice was screaming at me and I looked up to
see the baker’s wife, telling me to move on and did I want her
to call the Peacekeepers and how sick she was of having those
brats from the Seam pawing through her trash. The words
were ugly and I had no defense. As I carefully replaced the lid
and backed away, I noticed him, a boy with blond hair peering
out from behind his mother’s back. I’d seen him at school. He
was in my year, but I didn’t know his name. He stuck with the
town kids, so how would I? His mother went back into the bakery,
grumbling, but he must have been watching me as I
made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned
against the far side of an old apple tree. The realization that
I’d have nothing to take home had finally sunk in. My knees
buckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its roots. It was too
much. I was too sick and weak and tired, oh, so tired. Let them
call the Peacekeepers and take us to the community home, I
thought. Or better yet, let me die right here in the rain.
There was a clatter in the bakery and I heard the woman
screaming again and the sound of a blow, and I vaguely wondered
what was going on. Feet sloshed toward me through the
mud and I thought, It’s her. She’s coming to drive me away with
a stick. But it wasn’t her. It was the boy. In his arms, he carried
two large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire
because the crusts were scorched black.
His mother was yelling, Feed it to the pig, you stupid creature!
Why not? No one decent will buy burned bread!
He began to tear off chunks from the burned parts and toss
them into the trough, and the front bakery bell rung and the
mother disappeared to help a customer.
The boy never even glanced my way, but I was watching
him. Because of the bread, because of the red weal that stood
out on his cheekbone. What had she hit him with?
My parents never hit us. I couldn’t even imagine it. The boy
took one look back to the bakery as if checking that the coast
was clear, then, his attention back on the pig, he threw a loaf
of bread in my direction. The second quickly followed, and he
sloshed back to the bakery, closing the kitchen door tightly
behind him.
I stared at the loaves in disbelief. They were fine, perfect
really, except for the burned areas. Did he mean for me to
have them? He must have. Because there they were at my feet.
Before anyone could witness what had happened I shoved the
loaves up under my shirt, wrapped the hunting jacket tightly
about me, and walked swiftly away. The heat of the bread
burned into my skin, but I clutched it tighter, clinging to life.
By the time I reached home, the loaves had cooled somewhat,
but the insides were still warm. When I dropped them
on the table, Prim’s hands reached to tear off a chunk, but I
made her sit, forced my mother to join us at the table, and
poured warm tea. I scraped off the black stuff and sliced the
bread. We ate an entire loaf, slice by slice. It was good hearty
bread, filled with raisins and nuts.
I put my clothes to dry at the fire, crawled into bed, and fell
into a dreamless sleep. It didn’t occur to me until the next
morning that the boy might have burned the bread on purpose.
Might have dropped the loaves into the flames, knowing
it meant being punished, and then delivered them to me. But I
dismissed this. It must have been an accident. Why would he
have done it? He didn’t even know me. Still, just throwing me
the bread was an enormous kindness that would have surely
resulted in a beating if discovered. 1 couldn’t explain his actions.
We ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school. It
was as if spring had come overnight. Warm sweet air. Fluffy
clouds. At school, I passed the boy in the hall, his cheek had
swelled up and his eye had blackened. He was with his friends
and didn’t acknowledge me in any way. But as I collected Prim
and started for home that afternoon, I found him staring at me
from across the school yard. Our eyes met for only a second,
then he turned his head away. I dropped my gaze, embarrassed,
and that’s when I saw it. The first dandelion of the
year. A bell went off in my head. I thought of the hours spent
in the woods with my father and I knew how we were going to
survive.
To this day, I can never shake the connection between this
boy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me hope, and the
dandelion that reminded me that I was not doomed. And more
than once, I have turned in the school hallway and caught his
eyes trained on me, only to quickly flit away. I feel like I owe
him something, and I hate owing people. Maybe if I had
thanked him at some point, I’d be feeling less conflicted now. I
thought about it a couple of times, but the opportunity never
seemed to present itself. And now it never will. Because we’re
going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death. Exactly
how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow
it just won’t seem sincere if I’m trying to slit his throat.
The mayor finishes the dreary Treaty of Treason and motions
for Peeta and me to shake hands. His are as solid and
warm as those loaves of bread. Peeta looks me right in the eye
34
and gives my hand what I think is meant to be a reassuring
squeeze. Maybe it’s just a nervous spasm.
We turn back to face the crowd as the anthem of Panem
plays.
Oh, well, I think. There will be twenty-four of us. Odds are
someone else will kill him before I do.
Of course, the odds have not been very dependable of late.
35
The moment the anthem ends, we are taken into custody. I
don’t mean we’re handcuffed or anything, but a group of
Peacekeepers marches us through the front door of the Justice
Building. Maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past. I’ve
never seen that happen though.
Once inside, I’m conducted to a room and left alone. It’s the
richest place I’ve ever been in, with thick, deep carpets and a
velvet couch and chairs. I know velvet because my mother has
a dress with a collar made of the stuff. When I sit on the couch,
I can’t help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly. It
helps to calm me as I try to prepare for the next hour. The
time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved
ones. I cannot afford to get upset, to leave this room with puffy
eyes and a red nose. Crying is not an option. There will be
more cameras at the train station.
My sister and my mother come first. I reach out to Prim
and she climbs on my lap, her arms around my neck, head
on my shoulder, just like she did when she was a toddler.
My mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us.
For a few minutes, we say nothing. Then I start telling them
all the things they must remember to do, now that I will not be
there to do them for them.
36
Prim is not to take any tesserae. They can get by, if
they’re careful, on selling Prim’s goat milk and cheese and the
small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people
in the Seam. Gale will get her the herbs she doesn’t grow herself,
but she must be very careful to describe them because
he’s not as familiar with them as I am. He’ll also bring them
game — he and I made a pact about this a year or so ago —
and will probably not ask for compensation, but they should
thank him with some kind of trade, like milk or medicine.
I don’t bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt. I tried to teach
her a couple of times and it was disastrous. The woods terrified
her, and whenever I shot something, she’d get teary and
talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home
soon enough. But she makes out well with her goat, so I concentrate
on that.
When I am done with instructions about fuel, and trading,
and staying in school, I turn to my mother and grip her arm,
hard. Listen to me. Are you listening to me? She nods,
alarmed by my intensity. She must know what’s coming. You
can’t leave again, I say.
My mother’s eyes find the floor. I know. I won’t. I couldn’t
help what—
Well, you have to help it this time. You can’t clock out and
leave Prim on her own. There’s no me now to keep you both
alive. It doesn’t matter what happens. Whatever you see on
the screen. You have to promise me you’ll fight through it! My
voice has risen to a shout. In it is all the anger, all the fear I felt
at her abandonment.
37
She pulls her arm from my grasp, moved to anger herself
now. I was ill. I could have treated myself if I’d had the medicine
I have now.
That part about her being ill might be true. I’ve seen her
bring back people suffering from immobilizing sadness since.
Perhaps it is a sickness, but it’s one we can’t afford.
Then take it. And take care of her! I say.
I’ll be all right, Katniss, says Prim, clasping my face in her
hands. But you have to take care, too. You’re so fast and
brave. Maybe you can win.
I can’t win. Prim must know that in her heart. The competition
will be far beyond my abilities. Kids from wealthier districts,
where winning is a huge honor, who’ve been trained
their whole lives for this. Boys who are two to three times my
size. Girls who know twenty different ways to kill you with a
knife. Oh, there’ll be people like me, too. People to weed out
before the real fun begins.
Maybe, I say, because I can hardly tell my mother to carry
on if I’ve already given up myself. Besides, it isn’t in my nature
to go down without a fight, even when things seem insurmountable.
Then we’d be rich as Haymitch.
I don’t care if we’re rich. I just want you to come home.
You will try, won’t you? Really, really try? asks Prim.
Really, really try. I swear it, I say. And I know, because of
Prim, I’ll have to.
And then the Peacekeeper is at the door, signaling our time
is up, and we’re all hugging one another so hard it hurts and
all I’m saying is I love you. I love you both. And they’re say-
38
ing it back and then the Peacekeeper orders them out and the
door closes. I bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if
this can block the whole thing out.
Someone else enters the room, and when I look up, I’m surprised
to see it’s the baker, Peeta Mellark’s father. I can’t believe
he’s come to visit me. After all, I’ll be trying to kill his son
soon. But we do know each other a bit, and he knows Prim
even better. When she sells her goat cheeses at the Hob, she
puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous
amount of bread in return. We always wait to trade with him
when his witch of a wife isn’t around because he’s so much
nicer. I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way
she did over the burned bread. But why has he come to see
me?
The baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the plush
chairs. He’s a big, broad-shouldered man with burn scars from
years at the ovens. He must have just said goodbye to his son.
He pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and
holds it out to me. I open it and find cookies. These are a luxury
we can never afford.
Thank you, I say. The baker’s not a very talkative man in
the best of times, and today he has no words at all. I had
some of your bread this morning. My friend Gale gave you a
squirrel for it. He nods, as if remembering the squirrel. Not
your best trade, I say. He shrugs as if it couldn’t possibly matter.
Then I can’t think of anything else, so we sit in silence until
a Peacemaker summons him. He rises and coughs to clear his
39
throat. I’ll keep an eye on the little girl. Make sure she’s eating.
I feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words.
People deal with me, but they are genuinely fond of Prim.
Maybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive.
My next guest is also unexpected. Madge walks straight to
me. She is not weepy or evasive, instead there’s an urgency
about her tone that surprises me. They let you wear one
thing from your district in the arena. One thing to remind you
of home. Will you wear this? She holds out the circular gold
pin that was on her dress earlier. I hadn’t paid much attention
to it before, but now I see it’s a small bird in flight.
Your pin? I say. Wearing a token from my district is about
the last thing on my mind.
Here, I’ll put it on your dress, all right? Madge doesn’t
wait for an answer, she just leans in and fixes the bird to my
dress. Promise you’ll wear it into the arena, Katniss? she
asks. Promise?
Yes, I say. Cookies. A pin. I’m getting all kinds of gifts today.
Madge gives me one more. A kiss on the cheek. Then she’s
gone and I’m left thinking that maybe Madge really has been
my friend all along.
Finally, Gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic
between us, but when he opens his arms I don’t hesitate to go
into them. His body is familiar to me — the way it moves, the
smell of wood smoke, even the sound of his heart beating I
know from quiet moments on a hunt — but this is the first
time I really feel it, lean and hard-muscled against my own.
40
Listen, he says. Getting a knife should be pretty easy, but
you’ve got to get your hands on a bow. That’s your best
chance.
They don’t always have bows, I say, thinking of the year
there were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to
bludgeon one another to death with.
Then make one, says Gale. Even a weak bow is better
than no bow at all.
I have tried copying my father’s bows with poor results. It’s
not that easy. Even he had to scrap his own work sometimes.
I don’t even know if there’ll be wood, I say. Another year,
they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders
and sand and scruffy bushes. I particularly hated that year.
Many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went
insane from thirst.
There’s almost always some wood, Gale says. Since that
year half of them died of cold. Not much entertainment in
that.
It’s true. We spent one Hunger Games watching the players
freeze to death at night. You could hardly see them because
they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or
torches or anything. It was considered very anti-climactic in
the Capitol, all those quiet, bloodless deaths. Since then,
there’s usually been wood to make fires.
Yes, there’s usually some, I say.
Katniss, it’s just hunting. You’re the best hunter I know,
says Gale.
It’s not just hunting. They’re armed. They think, I say.
41
So do you. And you’ve had more practice. Real practice,

he says. You know how to kill.
Not people, I say.
How different can it be, really? says Gale grimly.
The awful thing is that if I can forget they’re people, it will
be no different at all.
The Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for more
time, but they’re taking him away and I start to panic. Don’t
let them starve! I cry out, clinging to his hand.
I won’t! You know I won’t! Katniss, remember I — he
says, and they yank us apart and slam the door and I’ll never
know what it was he wanted me to remember.
It’s a short ride from the Justice Building to the train station.
I’ve never been in a car before. Rarely even ridden in wagons.
In the Seam, we travel on foot.
I’ve been right not to cry. The station is swarming with reporters
with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my
face. But I’ve had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of
emotions and I do this now. I catch a glimpse of myself on the
television screen on the wall that’s airing my arrival live and
feel gratified that I appear almost bored.
Peeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been crying
and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover
it up. I immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the
Games. To appear weak and frightened, to reassure the other
tributes that he is no competition at all, and then come out
fighting. This worked very well for a girl, Johanna Mason, from
District 7 a few years back. She seemed like such a sniveling,
42
cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were
only a handful of contestants left. It turned out she could kill
viciously. Pretty clever, the way she played it. But this seems
an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because he’s a baker’s son.
All those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread
trays around have made him broad-shouldered and strong. It
will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook
him.
We have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the
train while the cameras gobble up our images, then we’re allowed
inside and the doors close mercifully behind us. The
train begins to move at once.
The speed initially takes my breath away. Of course, I’ve
never been on a train, as travel between the districts is forbidden
except for officially sanctioned duties. For us, that’s
mainly transporting coal. But this is no ordinary coal train. It’s
one of the high-speed Capitol models that average 250 miles
per hour. Our journey to the Capitol will take less than a day.
In school, they tell us the Capitol was built in a place once
called the Rockies. District 12 was in a region known is Appalachia.
Even hundreds of years ago, they mined coal here.
Which is why our miners have to dig so deep.
Somehow it all comes back to coal at school. Besides basic
reading and math most of our instruction is coal-related. Except
for the weekly lecture on the history of Panem. It’s mostly
a lot of blather about what we owe the Capitol. I know there
must be more than they’re telling us, an actual account of
what happened during the rebellion. But I don’t spend much
43
time thinking about it. Whatever the truth is, I don’t see how it
will help me get food on the table.
The tribute train is fancier than even the room in the Justice
Building. We are each given our own chambers that have
a bedroom, a dressing area, and a private bathroom with hot
and cold running water. We don’t have hot water at home, unless
we boil it.
There are drawers filled with fine clothes, and Effie Trinket
tells me to do anything I want, wear anything I want, everything
is at my disposal. Just be ready for supper in an hour. I
peel off my mother’s blue dress and take a hot shower. I’ve
never had a shower before. It’s like being in a summer rain,
only warmer. I dress in a dark green shirt and pants.
At the last minute, I remember Madge’s little gold pin. For
the first time, I get a good look at it. It’s as if someone fashioned
a small golden bird and then attached a ring around
it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips. I
suddenly recognize it. A mockingjay.
They’re funny birds and something of a slap in the face to
the Capitol. During the rebellion, the Capitol bred a series of
genetically altered animals as weapons. The common term for
them was muttations, or sometimes mutts for short. One was a
special bird called a jabberjay that had the ability to memorize
and repeat whole human conversations. They were homing
birds, exclusively male, that were released into regions where
the Capitol’s enemies were known to be hiding. After the birds
gathered words, they’d fly back to centers to be recorded. It
took people awhile to realize what was going on in the dis-
44
tricts, how private conversations were being transmitted.
Then, of course, the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies, and the
joke was on it. So the centers were shut down and the birds
were abandoned to die off in the wild.
Only they didn’t die off. Instead, the jabberjays mated with
female mockingbirds creating a whole new species that could
replicate both bird whistles and human melodies. They had
lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a
range of human vocal sounds, from a child’s high-pitched
warble to a man’s deep tones. And they could re-create songs.
Not just a few notes, but whole songs with multiple verses, if
you had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice.
My father was particularly fond of mockingjays. When we
went hunting, he would whistle or sing complicated songs to
them and, after a polite pause, they’d always sing back. Not
everyone is treated with such respect. But whenever my father
sang, all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen.
His voice was that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with
life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time. I could
never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone.
Still, there’s something comforting about the little bird. It’s
like having a piece of my father with me, protecting me. I fasten
the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a
background, I can almost imagine the mockingjay flying
through the trees.
Effie Trinket comes to collect me for supper. I follow her
through the narrow, rocking corridor into a dining room with
polished paneled walls. There’s a table where all the dishes
45
are highly breakable. Peeta Mellark sits waiting for us, the
chair next to him empty.
Where’s Haymitch? asks Effie Trinket brightly.
Last time I saw him, he said he was going to take a nap,
says Peeta.
Well, it’s been an exhausting day, says Effie Trinket. I
think she’s relieved by Haymitch’s absence, and who can
blame her?
The supper comes in courses. A thick carrot soup, green
salad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese and fruit, a
chocolate cake. Throughout the meal, Effie Trinket keeps reminding
us to save space because there’s more to come. But
I’m stuffing myself because I’ve never had food like this, so
good and so much, and because probably the best thing I can
do between now and the Games is put on a few pounds.
At least, you two have decent manners, says Effie as we’re
finishing the main course. The pair last year ate everything
with their hands like a couple of savages. It completely upset
my digestion.
The pair last year were two kids from the Seam who’d never,
not one day of their lives, had enough to eat. And when
they did have food, table manners were surely the last thing
on their minds. Peeta’s a baker’s son. My mother taught Prim
and I to eat properly, so yes, I can handle a fork and knife. But
I hate Effie Trinket’s comment so much I make a point of eating
the rest of my meal with my fingers. Then I wipe my hands
on the tablecloth. This makes her purse her lips tightly together.
46
Now that the meal’s over, I’m fighting to keep the food
down. I can see Peeta’s looking a little green, too. Neither of
our stomachs is used to such rich fare. But if I can hold down
Greasy Sae’s concoction of mice meat, pig entrails, and tree
bark — a winter specialty — I’m determined to hang on to
this.
We go to another compartment to watch the recap of the
reapings across Panem. They try to stagger them throughout
the day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing
live, but only people in the Capitol could really do that, since
none of them have to attend reapings themselves.
One by one, we see the other reapings, the names called,
(the volunteers stepping forward or, more often, not. We examine
the faces of the kids who will be our competition. A few
stand out in my mind. A monstrous boy who lunges forward
to volunteer from District 2. A fox-faced girl with sleek red
hair from District 5. A boy with a crippled foot from District
10. And most hauntingly, a twelve-year-old girl from District
11. She has dark brown skin and eyes, but other than that,
she’s very like Prim in size and demeanor. Only when she
mounts the stage and they ask for volunteers, all you can hear
is the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around
her. There’s no one willing to take her place.
Last of all, they show District 12. Prim being called, me
running forward to volunteer. You can’t miss the desperation
in my voice as I shove Prim behind me, as if I’m afraid no one
will hear and they’ll take Prim away. But, of course, they do
hear. I see Gale pulling her off me and watch myself mount the
47
stage. The commentators are not sure what to say about the
crowd’s refusal to applaud. The silent salute. One says that
District 12 has always been a bit backward but that local customs
can be charming. As if on cue, Haymitch falls off the
stage, and they groan comically. Peeta’s name is drawn, and he
quietly takes his place. We shake hands. They cut to the anthem
again, and the pro-gram ends.
Effie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in.
Your mentor has a lot to learn about presentation. A lot about
televised behavior.
Peeta unexpectedly laughs. He was drunk, says Peeta.
He’s drunk every year.
Every day, I add. I can’t help smirking a little. Effie Trinket
makes it sound like Haymitch just has somewhat rough manners
that could be corrected with a few tips from her.
Yes, hisses Effie Trinket. How odd you two find it amusing.
You know your mentor is your lifeline to the world in
these Games. The one who advises you, lines up your sponsors,
and dictates the presentation of any gifts. Haymitch can
well be the difference between your life and your death!
Just then, Haymitch staggers into the compartment. I miss
supper? he says in a slurred voice. Then he vomits all over
the expensive carpet and falls in the mess.
So laugh away! says Effie Trinket. She hops in her pointy
shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the room.
48
For a few moments, Peeta and I take in the scene of our
mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff from his
stomach. The reek of vomit and raw spirits almost brings my
dinner up. We exchange a glance. Obviously Haymitch isn’t
much, but Effie Trinket is right about one thing, once we’re in
the arena he’s all we’ve got. As if by some unspoken agreement,
Peeta and I each take one of Haymitch’s arms and help
him to his feet.
I tripped? Haymitch asks. Smells bad. He wipes his hand
on his nose, smearing his face with vomit.
Let’s get you back to your room, says Peeta. Clean you up
a bit.
We half-lead half-carry Haymitch back to his compartment.
Since we can’t exactly set him down on the embroidered bedspread,
we haul him into the bathtub and turn the shower on
him. He hardly notices.
It’s okay, Peeta says to me. I’ll take it from here.
I can’t help feeling a little grateful since the last thing I want
to do is strip down Haymitch, wash the vomit out of his chest
hair, and tuck him into bed. Possibly Peeta is trying to make a
good impression on him, to be his favorite once the Games be-
49
gin. But judging by the state he’s in, Haymitch will have no
memory of this tomorrow.
All right, I say. I can send one of the Capitol people to
help you. There’s any number on the train. Cooking lor us.
Waiting on us. Guarding us. Taking care of us is their job.
No. I don’t want them, says Peeta.
I nod and head to my own room. I understand how Peeta
feels. I can’t stand the sight of the Capitol people myself. But
making them deal with Haymitch might be a small form of revenge.
So I’m pondering the reason why he insists on taking
care of Haymitch and all of a sudden I think, It’s because he’s
being kind. Just as he was kind to give me the bread.
The idea pulls me up short. A kind Peeta Mellark is far more
dangerous to me than an unkind one. Kind people have a way
of working their way inside me and rooting there. And I can’t
let Peeta do this. Not where we’re going. So I decide, from this
moment on, to have as little as possible to do with the baker’s
son.
When I get back to my room, the train is pausing at a platform
to refuel. I quickly open the window, toss the cookies
Peeta’s father gave me out of the train, and slam the glass
shut. No more. No more of either of them.
Unfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground and
bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track. I only see
the image for a moment, because the train is off again, but it’s
enough. Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the
school yard years ago . . .
50
I had just turned away from Peeta Mellark’s bruised face
when I saw the dandelion and I knew hope wasn’t lost. I
plucked it carefully and hurried home. I grabbed a bucket and
Prim’s hand and headed to the Meadow and yes, it was dotted
with the golden-headed weeds. After we’d harvested those,
we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until
we’d filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, stems, and
flowers. That night, we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad
and the rest of the bakery bread.
What else? Prim asked me. What other food can we
find?
All kinds of things, I promised her. I just have to remember
them.
My mother had a book she’d brought with her from the
apothecary shop. The pages were made of old parchment and
covered in ink drawings of plants. Neat handwritten blocks
told their names, where to gather them, when they came in
bloom, their medical uses. But my father added other entries
to the book. Plants for eating, not healing. Dandelions, pokeweed,
wild onions, pines. Prim and I spent the rest of the night
poring over those pages.
The next day, we were off school. For a while I hung around
the edges of the Meadow, but finally I worked up the courage
to go under the fence. It was the first time I’d been there
alone, without my father’s weapons to protect me. But I retrieved
the small bow and arrows he’d made me from a hollow
tree. I probably didn’t go more than twenty yards into the
woods that day. Most of the time, I perched up in the branches
51
of an old oak, hoping for game to come by. After several hours,
I had the good luck to kill a rabbit.
I’d shot a few rabbits before, with my father’s guidance. But
this I’d done on my own.
We hadn’t had meat in months. The sight of the rabbit
seemed to stir something in my mother. She roused herself,
skinned the carcass, and made a stew with the meat and some
more greens Prim had gathered. Then she acted confused and
went back to bed, but when the stew was done, we made her
eat a bowl.
The woods became our savior, and each day I went a bit
farther into its arms. It was slow-going at first, but I was determined
to feed us. I stole eggs from nests, caught fish in nets,
sometimes managed to shoot a squirrel or rabbit for stew, and
gathered the various plants that sprung up beneath my feet.
Plants are tricky. Many are edible, but one false mouthful and
you’re dead. I checked and double-checked the plants I harvested
with my father’s pictures. I kept us alive.
Any sign of danger, a distant howl, the inexplicable break of
a branch, sent me flying back to the fence at first. Then I began
to risk climbing trees to escape the wild dogs that quickly got
bored and moved on. Bears and cats lived deeper in, perhaps
disliking the sooty reek of our district.
On May 8th, I went to the Justice Building, signed up formy
tesserae, and pulled home my first batch of grain and oil in
Prim’s toy wagon. On the eighth of every month, I was entitled
to do the same. I couldn’t stop hunting and gathering, of
course. The grain was not enough to live on, and there were
52
other things to buy, soap and milk and thread. What we didn’t
absolutely have to eat, I began to trade at the Hob. It was
frightening to enter that place without my father at my side,
but people had respected him, and they accepted me. Game
was game after all, no matter who’d shot it. I also sold at the
back doors of the wealthier clients in town, trying to remember
what my father had told me and learning a few new tricks
as well. The butcher would buy my rabbits but not squirrels.
The baker enjoyed squirrel but would only trade for one if his
wife wasn’t around. The Head Peacekeeper loved wild turkey.
The mayor had a passion for strawberries.
In late summer, I was washing up in a pond when I noticed
the plants growing around me. Tall with leaves like arrowheads.
Blossoms with three white petals. I knelt down in the
water, my fingers digging into the soft mud, and I pulled up
handfuls of the roots. Small, bluish tubers that don’t look like
much but boiled or baked are as good as any potato. Katniss,
I said aloud. It’s the plant I was named for. And I heard my father’s
voice joking, As long as you can find yourself, you’ll
never starve. I spent hours stirring up the pond bed with my
toes and a stick, gathering the tubers that floated to the top.
That night, we feasted on fish and katniss roots until we were
all, for the first time in months, full.
Slowly, my mother returned to us. She began to clean and
cook and preserve some of the food I brought in for winter.
People traded us or paid money for her medical remedies. One
day, I heard her singing.
53
Prim was thrilled to have her back, but I kept watching,
waiting for her to disappear on us again. I didn’t trust her. And
some small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weakness,
for her neglect, for the months she had put us through.
Prim forgave her, but I had taken a step back from my mother,
put up a wall to protect myself from needing her, and nothing
was ever the same between us again.
Now I was going to die without that ever being set right. I
thought of how I had yelled at her today in the Justice Building.
I had told her I loved her, too, though. So maybe it would
all balance out.
For a while I stand staring out the train window, wishing I
could open it again, but unsure of what would happen at such
high speed. In the distance, I see the lights of another district.
7? 10? I don’t know. I think about the people in their houses,
settling in for bed. I imagine my home, with its shutters drawn
tight. What are they doing now, my mother and Prim? Were
they able to eat supper? The fish stew and the strawberries?
Or did it lay untouched on their plates? Did they watch the recap
of the day’s events on the battered old TV that sits on the
table against the wall? Surely, there were more tears. Is my
mother holding up, being strong for Prim? Or has she already
started to slip away, leaving the weight of the world on my sister’s
fragile shoulders?
Prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight. The
thought of that scruffy old Buttercup posting himself on the
bed to watch over Prim comforts me. If she cries, he will nose
54
his way into her arms and curl up there until she calms down
and falls asleep. I’m so glad I didn’t drown him.
Imagining my home makes me ache with loneliness. This
day has been endless. Could Gale and I have been eating
blackberries only this morning? It seems like a lifetime ago.
Like a long dream that deteriorated into a nightmare. Maybe,
if I go to sleep, I will wake up back in District 12, where I belong.
Probably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns, but I
just strip off my shirt and pants and climb into bed in my underwear.
The sheets are made of soft, silky fabric. A thick fluffy
comforter gives immediate warmth.
If I’m going to cry, now is the time to do it. By morning, I’ll
be able to wash the damage done by the tears from my face.
But no tears come. I’m too tired or too numb to cry. The only
thing I feel is a desire to be somewhere else. So I let the train
rock me into oblivion.
Gray light is leaking through the curtains when the rapping
rouses me. I hear Effie Trinket’s voice, calling me to rise. Up,
up, up! It’s going to be a big, big, big day! I try and imagine,
for a moment, what it must be like inside that woman’s head.
What thoughts fill her waking hours? What dreams come to
her at night? I have no idea.
I put the green outfit back on since it’s not really dirty, just
slightly crumpled from spending the night on the floor. My
fingers trace the circle around the little gold mockingjay and I
think of the woods, and of my father, and of my mother and
Prim waking up, having to get on with things.
55
I slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for the
reaping and it doesn’t look too bad, so I just leave it up. It
doesn’t matter. We can’t be far from the Capitol now. And
once we reach the city, my stylist will dictate my look for the
opening ceremonies tonight anyway. I just hope I get one who
doesn’t think nudity is the last word in fashion.
As I enter the dining car, Effie Trinket brushes by me with a
cup of black coffee. She’s muttering obscenities under her
breath. Haymitch, his face puffy and red from the previous
day’s indulgences, is chuckling. Peeta holds a roll and looks
somewhat embarrassed.
Sit down! Sit down! says Haymitch, waving me over. The
moment I slide into my chair I’m served an enormous platter
of food. Eggs, ham, piles of fried potatoes. A tureen of fruit sits
in ice to keep it chilled. The basket of rolls they set before me
would keep my family going for a week. There’s an elegant
glass of orange juice. At least, I think it’s orange juice. I’ve only
even tasted an orange once, at New Year’s when my father
bought one as a special treat. A cup of coffee. My mother
adores coffee, which we could almost never afford, but it only
tastes bitter and thin to me. A rich brown cup of something
I’ve never seen.
They call it hot chocolate, says Peeta. It’s good.
I take a sip of the hot, sweet, creamy liquid and a shudder
runs through me. Even though the rest of the meal beckons, I
ignore it until I’ve drained my cup. Then I stuff down every
mouthful I can hold, which is a substantial amount, being careful
to not overdo it on the richest stuff. One time, my mother
56
told me that I always eat like I’ll never see food again. And I
said, I won’t unless I bring it home. That shut her up.
When my stomach feels like it’s about to split open, I lean
back and take in my breakfast companions. Peeta is still eating,
breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate.
Haymitch hasn’t paid much attention to his platter, but he’s
knocking back a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with
a clear liquid from a bottle. Judging by the fumes, it’s some
kind of spirit. I don’t know Haymitch, but I’ve seen him often
enough in the Hob, tossing handfuls of money on the counter
of the woman who sells white liquor. He’ll be incoherent by
the time we reach the Capitol.
I realize I detest Haymitch. No wonder the District 12 tributes
never stand a chance. It isn’t just that we’ve been underfed
and lack training. Some of our tributes have still been
strong enough to make a go of it. But we rarely get sponsors
and he’s a big part of the reason why. The rich people who
back tributes — either because they’re betting on them or
simply for the bragging rights of picking a winner — expect
someone classier than Haymitch to deal with.
So, you’re supposed to give us advice, I say to Haymitch.
Here’s some advice. Stay alive, says Haymitch, and then
bursts out laughing. I exchange a look with Peeta before I remember
I’m having nothing more to do with him. I’m surprised
to see the hardness in his eyes. He generally seems so
mild.
That’s very funny, says Peeta. Suddenly he lashes out at
the glass in Haymitch’s hand. It shatters on the floor, sending
57
the bloodred liquid running toward the back of the train. Only
not to us.
Haymitch considers this a moment, then punches Peeta in
the jaw, knocking him from his chair. When he turns back to
reach for the spirits, I drive my knife into the table between
his hand and the bottle, barely missing his fingers. I brace myself
to deflect his hit, but it doesn’t come. Instead he sits back
and squints at us.
Well, what’s this? says Haymitch. Did I actually get a pair
of fighters this year?
Peeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of ice
from under the fruit tureen. He starts to raise it to the red
mark on his jaw.
No, says Haymitch, stopping him. Let the bruise show.
The audience will think you’ve mixed it up with another tribute
before you’ve even made it to the arena.
That’s against the rules, says Peeta.
Only if they catch you. That bruise will say you fought, you
weren’t caught, even better, says Haymitch. He turns to me.
Can you hit anything with that knife besides a table?
The bow and arrow is my weapon. But I’ve spent a fair
amount of time throwing knives as well. Sometimes, if I’ve
wounded an animal with an arrow, it’s better to get a knife into
it, too, before I approach it. I realize that if I want Haymitch’s
attention, this is my moment to make an impression. I
yank the knife out of the table, get a grip on the blade, and
then throw it into the wall across the room. I was actually just
58
hoping to get a good solid stick, but it lodges in the seam between
two panels, making me look a lot better than I am.
Stand over here. Both of you, says Haymitch, nodding to
the middle of the room. We obey and he circles us, prodding
us like animals at times, checking our muscles, examining our
faces. Well, you’re not entirely hopeless. Seem fit. And once
the stylists get hold of you, you’ll be attractive enough.
Peeta and I don’t question this. The Hunger Games aren’t a
beauty contest, but the best-looking tributes always seem to
pull more sponsors.
All right, I’ll make a deal with you. You don’t interfere with
my drinking, and I’ll stay sober enough to help you, says
Haymitch. But you have to do exactly what I say.
It’s not much of a deal but still a giant step forward from
ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all.
Fine, says Peeta.
So help us, I say. When we get to the arena, what’s the
best strategy at the Cornucopia for someone —
One thing at a time. In a few minutes, we’ll be pulling into
the station. You’ll be put in the hands of your stylists. You’re
not going to like what they do to you. But no matter what it is,
don’t resist, says Haymitch.
But — I begin.
No buts. Don’t resist, says Haymitch. He takes the bottle
of spirits from the table and leaves the car. As the door swings
shut behind him, the car goes dark. There are still a few lights
inside, but outside it’s as if night has fallen again. I realize we
must be in the tunnel that runs up through the mountains into
59
the Capitol. The mountains form a natural barrier between the
Capitol and the eastern districts. It is almost impossible to enter
from the east except through the tunnels. This geographical
advantage was a major factor in the districts losing the war
that led to my being a tribute today. Since the rebels had to
scale the mountains, they were easy targets for the Capitol’s
air forces.
Peeta Mellark and I stand in silence as the train speeds
along. The tunnel goes on and on and I think of the tons of
rock separating me from the sky, and my chest tightens. I hate
being encased in stone this way. It reminds me of the mines
and my father, trapped, unable to reach sunlight, buried forever
in the darkness.
The train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light
floods the compartment. We can’t help it. Both Peeta and I run
to the window to see what we’ve only seen on television, the
Capitol, the ruling city of Panem. The cameras haven’t lied
about its grandeur. If anything, they have not quite captured
the magnificence of the glistening buildings in a rainbow of
hues that tower into the air, the shiny cars that roll down the
wide paved streets, the oddly dressed people with bizarre hair
and painted faces who have never missed a meal. All the colors
seem artificial, the pinks too deep, the greens too bright,
the yellows painful to the eyes, like the flat round disks of
hard candy we can never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop
in District 12.
The people begin to point at us eagerly as they recognize a
tribute train rolling into the city. I step away from the win-
60
dow, sickened by their excitement, knowing they can’t wait to
watch us die. But Peeta holds his ground, actually waving and
smiling at the gawking crowd. He only stops when the train
pulls into the station, blocking us from their view.
He sees me staring at him and shrugs. Who knows? he
says. One of them may be rich.
I have misjudged him. I think of his actions since the reaping
began. The friendly squeeze of my hand. His father showing
up with the cookies and promising to feed Prim . . . did
Peeta put him up to that? His tears at the station. Volunteering
to wash Haymitch but then challenging him this morning
when apparently the nice-guy approach had failed. And now
the waving at the window, already trying to win the crowd.
All of the pieces are still fitting together, but I sense he has
a plan forming. He hasn’t accepted his death. He is already
fighting hard to stay alive. Which also means that kind Peeta
Mellark, the boy who gave me the bread, is fighting hard to kill
me.
61
R-i-i-i-p! I grit my teeth as Venia, a woman with aqua hair
and gold tattoos above her eyebrows, yanks a strip of Fabric
from my leg tearing out the hair beneath it. Sorry! she pipes
in her silly Capitol accent. You’re just so hairy!
Why do these people speak in such a high pitch? Why do
their jaws barely open when they talk? Why do the ends of
their sentences go up as if they’re asking a question? Odd vowels,
clipped words, and always a hiss on the letter s . . . no
wonder it’s impossible not to mimic them.
Venia makes what’s supposed to be a sympathetic face.
Good news, though. This is the last one. Ready? I get a grip
on the edges of the table I’m seated on and nod. The final
swathe of my leg hair is uprooted in a painful jerk.
I’ve been in the Remake Center for more than three hours
and I still haven’t met my stylist. Apparently he has no interest
in seeing me until Venia and the other members of my prep
team have addressed some obvious problems. This has included
scrubbing down my body with a gritty loam that has
removed not only dirt but at least three layers of skin, turning
my nails into uniform shapes, and primarily, ridding my body
of hair. My legs, arms, torso, underarms, and parts of my eyebrows
have been stripped of the Muff, leaving me like a
62
plucked bird, ready for roasting. I don’t like it. My skin feels
sore and tingling and intensely vulnerable. But I have kept my
side of the bargain with Haymitch, and no objection has
crossed my lips.
You’re doing very well, says some guy named Flavius. He
gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake and applies a fresh
coat of purple lipstick to his mouth. If there’s one thing we
can’t stand, it’s a whiner. Grease her down!
Venia and Octavia, a plump woman whose entire body has
been dyed a pale shade of pea green, rub me down with a lotion
that first stings but then soothes my raw skin. Then they
pull me from the table, removing the thin robe I’ve been allowed
to wear off and on. I stand there, completely naked, as
the three circle me, wielding tweezers to remove any last bits
of hair. I know I should be embarrassed, but they’re so unlike
people that I’m no more self-conscious than if a trio of oddly
colored birds were pecking around my feet.
The three step back and admire their work. Excellent! You
almost look like a human being now! says Flavius, and they
all laugh.
I force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful I am.
Thank you, I say sweetly. We don’t have much cause to look
nice in District Twelve.
This wins them over completely. Of course, you don’t, you
poor darling! says Octavia clasping her hands together in distress
for me.
But don’t worry, says Venia. By the time Cinna is through
with you, you’re going to be absolutely gorgeous!
63
We promise! You know, now that we’ve gotten rid of all
the hair and filth, you’re not horrible at all! says Flavius encouragingly.
Let’s call Cinna!
They dart out of the room. It’s hard to hate my prep team.
They’re such total idiots. And yet, in an odd way, I know
they’re sincerely trying to help me.
I look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the impulse
to retrieve my robe. But this Cinna, my stylist, will surely
make me remove it at once. Instead my hands go to my
hairdo, the one area of my body my prep team had been told
to leave alone. My fingers stroke the silky braids my mother
so carefully arranged. My mother. I left her blue dress and
shoes on the floor of my train car, never thinking about retrieving
them, of trying to hold on to a piece of her, of home.
Now I wish I had.
The door opens and a young man who must be Cinna enters.
I’m taken aback by how normal he looks. Most of the stylists
they interview on television are so dyed, stenciled, and
surgically altered they’re grotesque. But Cinna’s closecropped
hair appears to be its natural shade of brown. He’s in
a simple black shirt and pants. The only concession to selfalteration
seems to be metallic gold eyeliner that has been applied
with a light hand. It brings out the flecks of gold in his
green eyes. And, despite my disgust with the Capitol and their
hideous fashions, I can’t help thinking how attractive it looks.
Hello, Katniss. I’m Cinna, your stylist, he says in a quiet
voice somewhat lacking in the Capitol’s affectations.
Hello, I venture cautiously.
64
Just give me a moment, all right? he asks. He walks
around my naked body, not touching me, but taking in every
inch of it with his eyes. I resist the impulse to cross my arms
over my chest. Who did your hair?
My mother, I say.
It’s beautiful. Classic really. And in almost perfect balance
with your profile. She has very clever fingers, he says.
I had expected someone flamboyant, someone older trying
desperately to look young, someone who viewed me as a piece
of meat to be prepared for a platter. Cinna has met none of
these expectations.
You’re new, aren’t you? I don’t think I’ve seen you before,
I say. Most of the stylists are familiar, constants in the everchanging
pool of tributes. Some have been around my whole
life.
Yes, this is my first year in the Games, says Cinna.
So they gave you District Twelve, I say. Newcomers generally
end up with us, the least desirable district.
I asked for District Twelve, he says without further explanation.
Why don’t you put on your robe and we’ll have a
chat.
Pulling on my robe, I follow him through a door into a sitting
room. Two red couches face off over a low table. Three
walls are blank, the fourth is entirely glass, providing a window
to the city. I can see by the light that it must be around
noon, although the sunny sky has turned overcast. Cinna invites
me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across
from me. He presses a button on the side of the table. The top
65
splits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our
lunch. Chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy
sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain, tiny green peas and
onions, rolls shaped like flowers, and for dessert, a pudding
the color of honey.
I try to imagine assembling this meal myself back home.
Chickens are too expensive, but I could make do with a wild
turkey. I’d need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an
orange. Goat’s milk would have to substitute for cream. We
can grow peas in the garden. I’d have to get wild onions from
the woods. I don’t recognize the grain, our own tessera ration
cooks down to an unattractive brown mush. Fancy rolls would
mean another trade with the baker, perhaps for two or three
squirrels. As for the pudding, I can’t even guess what’s in it.
Days of hunting and gathering for this one meal and even then
it would be a poor substitution for the Capitol version.
What must it be like, I wonder, to live in a world where
food appears at the press of a button? How would I spend the
hours I now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it
were so easy to come by? What do they do all day, these
people in the Capitol, besides decorating their bodies and
waiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and
die for their entertainment?
I look up and find Cinna’s eyes trained on mine. How despicable
we must seem to you, he says.
Has he seen this in my face or somehow read my thoughts?
He’s right, though. The whole rotten lot of them is despicable.
66
No matter, says Cinna. So, Katniss, about your costume
for the opening ceremonies. My partner, Portia, is the stylist
for your fellow tribute, Peeta. And our current thought is to
dress you in complementary costumes, says Cinna. As you
know, it’s customary to reflect the flavor of the district.
For the opening ceremonies, you’re supposed to wear
something that suggests your district’s principal industry. District
11, agriculture. District 4, fishing. District 3, factories.
This means that coming from District 12, Peeta and I will be in
some kind of coal miner’s getup. Since the baggy miner’s
jumpsuits are not particularly becoming, our tributes usually
end up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps. One year,
our tributes were stark naked and covered in black powder to
represent coal dust. It’s always dreadful and does nothing to
win favor with the crowd. I prepare myself for the worst.
So, I’ll be in a coal miner outfit? I ask, hoping it won’t be
indecent.
Not exactly. You see, Portia and I think that coal miner
thing’s very overdone. No one will remember you in that. And
we both see it as our job to make the District Twelve tributes
unforgettable, says Cinna.
I’ll be naked for sure, I think.
So rather than focus on the coal mining itself, we’re going
to focus on the coal, says Cinna. Naked and covered in black
dust, I think. And what do we do with coal? We burn it, says
Cinna.
You’re not afraid of fire, are you, Katniss? He sees my expression
and grins.
67
A few hours later, I am dressed in what will either be the
most sensational or the deadliest costume in the opening ceremonies.
I’m in a simple black unitard that covers me from
ankle to neck. Shiny leather boots lace up to my knees. But it’s
the fluttering cape made of streams of orange, yellow, and red
and the matching headpiece that define this costume. Cinna
plans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls into the
streets.
It’s not real flame, of course, just a little synthetic fire Portia
and I came up with. You’ll be perfectly safe, he says. But
I’m not convinced I won’t be perfectly barbecued by the time
we reach the city’s center.
My face is relatively clear of makeup, just a bit of highlighting
here and there. My hair has been brushed out and then
braided down my back in my usual style. I want the audience
to recognize you when you’re in the arena, says Cinna dreamily.
Katniss, the girl who was on fire.
It crosses my mind that Cinna’s calm and normal demeanor
masks a complete madman.
Despite this morning’s revelation about Peeta’s character,
I’m actually relieved when he shows up, dressed in an identical
costume. He should know about fire, being a baker’s son
and all. His stylist, Portia, and her team accompany him in,
and everyone is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a
splash we’ll make. Except Cinna. He just seems a bit weary as
he accepts congratulations.
We’re whisked down to the bottom level of the Remake
Center, which is essentially a gigantic stable. The opening ce-
68
remonies are about to start. Pairs of tributes are being loaded
into chariots pulled by teams of four horses. Ours are coal
black. The animals are so well trained, no one even needs to
guide their reins. Cinna and Portia direct us into the chariot
and carefully arrange our body positions, the drape of our
capes, before moving off to consult with each other.
What do you think? I whisper to Peeta. About the fire?
I’ll rip off your cape if you’ll rip off mine, he says through
gritted teeth.
Deal, I say. Maybe, if we can get them off soon enough,
we’ll avoid the worst burns. It’s bad though. They’ll throw us
into the arena no matter what condition we’re in. I know we
promised Haymitch we’d do exactly what they said, but I don’t
think he considered this angle.
Where is Haymitch, anyway? Isn’t he supposed to protect
us from this sort of thing? says Peeta.
With all that alcohol in him, it’s probably not advisable to
have him around an open flame, I say.
And suddenly we’re both laughing. I guess we’re both so
nervous about the Games and more pressingly, petrified of being
turned into human torches, we’re not acting sensibly.
The opening music begins. It’s easy to hear, blasted around
the Capitol. Massive doors slide open revealing the crowdlined
streets. The ride lasts about twenty minutes and ends up
at the City Circle, where they will welcome us, play the anthem,
and escort us into the Training Center, which will be our
home/prison until the Games begin.
69
The tributes from District 1 ride out in a chariot pulled by
snow-white horses. They look so beautiful, spray-painted silver,
in tasteful tunics glittering with jewels. District 1 makes
luxury items for the Capitol. You can hear the roar of the
crowd. They are always favorites.
District 2 gets into position to follow them. In no time at all,
we are approaching the door and I can see that between the
overcast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray. The
tributes from District 11 are just rolling out when Cinna appears
with a lighted torch. Here we go then, he says, and before
we can react he sets our capes on fire. I gasp, waiting for
the heat, but there is only a faint tickling sensation. Cinna
climbs up before us and ignites our headdresses. He lets out a
sign of relief. It works. Then he gently tucks a hand under
my chin. Remember, heads high. Smiles. They’re going to love
you!
Cinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea. He shouts
something up at us, but the music drowns him out. He shouts
again and gestures.
What’s he saying? I ask Peeta. For the first time, I look at
him and realize that ablaze with the fake flames, he is dazzling.
And I must be, too.
I think he said for us to hold hands, says Peeta. He grabs
my right hand in his left, and we look to Cinna for confirmation.
He nods and gives a thumbs-up, and that’s the last thing I
see before we enter the city.
The crowd’s initial alarm at our appearance quickly
changes to cheers and shouts of District Twelve! Every head
70
is turned our way, pulling the focus from the three chariots
ahead of us. At first, I’m frozen, but then I catch sight of us on
a large television screen and am floored by how breathtaking
we look. In the deepening twilight, the firelight illuminates
our faces. We seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing
capes. Cinna was right about the minimal makeup, we both
look more attractive but utterly recognizable.
Remember, heads high. Smiles. They’re going to love you! I
hear Cinna’s voice in my head. I lift my chin a bit higher, put
on my most winning smile, and wave with my free hand. I’m
glad now I have Peeta to clutch for balance, he is so steady,
solid as a rock. As I gain confidence, I actually blow a few
kisses to the crowd. The people of the Capitol are going nuts,
showering us with flowers, shouting our names, our first
names, which they have bothered to find on the program.
The pounding music, the cheers, the admiration work their
way into my blood, and I can’t suppress my excitement. Cinna
has given me a great advantage. No one will forget me. Not my
look, not my name. Katniss. The girl who was on fire.
For the first time, I feel a flicker of hope rising up in me.
Surely, there must be one sponsor willing to take me on! And
with a little extra help, some food, the right weapon, why
should I count myself out of the Games?
Someone throws me a red rose. I catch it, give it a delicate
sniff, and blow a kiss back in the general direction of the giver.
A hundred hands reach up to catch my kiss, as if it were a real
and tangible thing.
71
Katniss! Katniss! I can hear my name being called from all
sides. Everyone wants my kisses.
It’s not until we enter the City Circle that I realize I must
have completely stopped the circulation in Peeta’s hand.
That’s how tightly I’ve been holding it. I look down at our
linked fingers as I loosen my grasp, but he regains his grip on
me. No, don’t let go of me, he says. The firelight flickers off
his blue eyes. Please. I might fall out of this thing.
Okay, I say. So I keep holding on, but I can’t help feeling
strange about the way Cinna has linked us together. It’s not
really fair to present us as a team and then lock us into the
arena to kill each other.
The twelve chariots fill the loop of the City Circle. On the
buildings that surround the Circle, every window is packed
with the most prestigious citizens of the Capitol. Our horses
pull our chariot right up to President Snow’s mansion, and we
come to a halt. The music ends with a flourish.
The president, a small, thin man with paper-white hair,
gives the official welcome from a balcony above us. It is traditional
to cut away to the faces of the tributes during the
speech. But I can see on the screen that we are getting way
more than our share of airtime. The darker it becomes, the
more difficult it is to take your eyes off our flickering. When
the national anthem plays, they do make an effort to do a
quick cut around to each pair of tributes, but the camera holds
on the District 12 chariot as it parades around the circle one
final time and disappears into the Training Center.
72
The doors have only just shut behind us when we’re engulfed
by the prep teams, who are nearly unintelligible as they
babble out praise. As I glance around, I notice a lot of the other
tributes are shooting us dirty looks, which confirms what I’ve
suspected, we’ve literally outshone them all. Then Cinna and
Portia are there, helping us down from the chariot, carefully
removing our flaming capes and headdresses. Portia extinguishes
them with some kind of spray from a canister.
I realize I’m still glued to Peeta and force my stiff fingers to
open. We both massage our hands.
Thanks for keeping hold of me. I was getting a little shaky
there, says Peeta.
It didn’t show, I tell him. I’m sure no one noticed.
I’m sure they didn’t notice anything but you. You should
wear flames more often, he says. They suit you. And then he
gives me a smile that seems so genuinely sweet with just the
right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes
through me.
A warning bell goes off in my head. Don’t be so stupid. Peeta
is planning how to kill you, I remind myself. He is luring you in
to make you easy prey. The more likable he is, the more deadly
he is.
But because two can play at this game, I stand on tiptoe and
kiss his cheek. Right on his bruise.
73
The Training Center has a tower designed exclusively for
the tributes and their teams. This will be our home until the
actual Games begin. Each district has an entire floor. You
simply step onto an elevator and press the number of your
district. Easy enough to remember.
I’ve ridden the elevator a couple of times in the Justice
Building back in District 12. Once to receive the medal for my
father’s death and then yesterday to say my final goodbyes to
my friends and family. But that’s a dark and creaky thing that
moves like a snail and smells of sour milk. The walls of this
elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people
on the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into the air.
It’s exhilarating and I’m tempted to ask Effie Trinket if we can
ride it again, but somehow that seems childish.
Apparently, Effie Trinket’s duties did not conclude at the
station. She and Haymitch will be overseeing us right into the
arena. In a way, that’s a plus because at least she can be
counted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we
haven’t seen Haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train.
Probably passed out somewhere. Effie Trinket, on the other
hand, seems to be flying high. We’re the first team she’s ever
chaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies.
74
She’s complimentary about not just our costumes but how we
conducted ourselves. And, to hear her tell it, Effie knows everyone
who’s anyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up
all day, trying to win us sponsors.
I’ve been very mysterious, though, she says, her eyes
squint half shut. Because, of course, Haymitch hasn’t bothered
to tell me your strategies. But I’ve done my best with
what I had to work with. How Katniss sacrificed herself for
her sister. How you’ve both successfully struggled to overcome
the barbarism of your district.
Barbarism? That’s ironic coming from a woman helping to
prepare us for slaughter. And what’s she basing our success
on? Our table manners?
Everyone has their reservations, naturally. You being from
the coal district. But I said, and this was very clever of me, I
said, ‘Well, if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to
pearls!’ Effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice
but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though
it’s wrong.
Coal doesn’t turn to pearls. They grow in shellfish. Possibly
she meant coal turns to diamonds, but that’s untrue, too. I’ve
heard they have some sort of machine in District 1 that can
turn graphite into diamonds. But we don’t mine graphite in
District 12. That was part of District 13’s job until they were
destroyed.
I wonder if the people she’s been plugging us to all day either
know or care.
75
Unfortunately, I can’t seal the sponsor deals for you. Only
Haymitch can do that, says Effie grimly. But don’t worry, I’ll
get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary.
Although lacking in many departments, Effie Trinket has a
certain determination I have to admire.
My quarters are larger than our entire house back home.
They are plush, like the train car, but also have so many automatic
gadgets that I’m sure I won’t have time to press all the
buttons. The shower alone has a panel with more than a hundred
options you can choose regulating water temperature,
pressure, soaps, shampoos, scents, oils, and massaging
sponges. When you step out on a mat, heaters come on that
blow-dry your body. Instead of struggling with the knots in
my wet hair, I merely place my hand on a box that sends a
current through my scalp, untangling, parting, and drying my
hair almost instantly. It floats down around my shoulders in a
glossy curtain.
I program the closet for an outfit to my taste. The windows
zoom in and out on parts of the city at my command. You need
only whisper a type of food from a gigantic menu into a
mouthpiece and it appears, hot and steamy, before you in less
than a minute. I walk around the room eating goose liver and
puffy bread until there’s a knock on the door. Effie’s calling me
to dinner.
Good. I’m starving.
Peeta, Cinna, and Portia are standing out on a balcony that
overlooks the Capitol when we enter the dining room. I’m glad
76
to see the stylists, particularly after I hear that Haymitch will
be joining us. A meal presided over by just
Effie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster. Besides, dinner
isn’t really about food, it’s about planning out our strategies,
and Cinna and Portia have already proven how valuable
they are.
A silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us all
stemmed glasses of wine. I think about turning it down, but
I’ve never had wine, except the homemade stuff my mother
uses for coughs, and when will I get a chance to try it again? I
take a sip of the tart, dry liquid and secretly think it could be
improved by a few spoonfuls of honey.
Haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served. It looks
as if he’s had his own stylist because he’s clean and groomed
and about as sober as I’ve ever seen him. He doesn’t refuse the
offer of wine, but when he starts in on his soup, I realize it’s
the first time I’ve ever seen him eat. Maybe he really will pull
himself together long enough to help us.
Cinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on Haymitch
and Effie. At least they’re addressing each other decently.
And they both have nothing but praise for our stylists’
opening act. While they make small talk, I concentrate on the
meal. Mushroom soup, bitter greens with tomatoes the size of
peas, rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper, noodles in a green
sauce, cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet
blue grapes. The servers, all young people dressed in white
tunics like the one who gave us wine, move wordlessly to and
from the table, keeping the platters and glasses full.
77
About halfway through my glass of wine, my head starts
feeling foggy, so I change to water instead. I don’t like the feeling
and hope it wears off soon. How Haymitch can stand walking
around like this full-time is a mystery.
I try to focus on the talk, which has turned to our interview
costumes, when a girl sets a gorgeous-looking cake on the table
and deftly lights it. It blazes up and then the flames flicker
around the edges awhile until it finally goes out. I have a moment
of doubt. What makes it burn? Is it alcohol? I say, looking
up at the girl. That’s the last thing I wa — oh! I know
you!
I can’t place a name or time to the girl’s face. But I’m certain
of it. The dark red hair, the striking features, the porcelain
white skin. But even as I utter the words, I feel my insides contracting
with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her, and while I
can’t pull it up, I know some bad memory is associated with
her. The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds
to my confusion and unease. She shakes her head in denial
quickly and hurries away from the table.
When I look back, the four adults are watching me like
hawks.
Don’t be ridiculous, Katniss. How could you possibly know
an Avox? snaps Effie. The very thought.
What’s an Avox? I ask stupidly.
Someone who committed a crime. They cut her tongue so
she can’t speak, says Haymitch. She’s probably a traitor of
some sort. Not likely you’d know her.
78
And even if you did, you’re not to speak to one of them unless
it’s to give an order, says Effie. Of course, you don’t really
know her.
But I do know her. And now that Haymitch has mentioned
the word traitor I remember from where. The disapproval is
so high I could never admit it. No, I guess not, I just — I
stammer, and the wine is not helping.
Peeta snaps his fingers. Delly Cartwright. That’s who it is. I
kept thinking she looked familiar as well. Then I realized she’s
a dead ringer for Delly.
Delly Cartwright is a pasty-faced, lumpy girl with yellowish
hair who looks about as much like our server as a beetle does
a butterfly. She may also be the friendliest person on the planet
— she smiles constantly at everybody in school, even me. I
have never seen the girl with the red hair smile. But I jump on
Peeta’s suggestion gratefully. Of course, that’s who I was
thinking of. It must be the hair, I say.
Something about the eyes, too, says Peeta.
The energy at the table relaxes. Oh, well. If that’s all it is,
says Cinna. And yes, the cake has spirits, but all the alcohol
has burned off. I ordered it specially in honor of your fiery debut.
We eat the cake and move into a sitting room to watch the
replay of the opening ceremonies that’s being broadcast. A
few of the other couples make a nice impression, but none of
them can hold a candle to us. Even our own party lets out an
Ahh! as they show us coming out of the Remake Center.
Whose idea was the hand holding? asks Haymitch.
79
Cinna’s, says Portia.
Just the perfect touch of rebellion, says Haymitch. Very
nice.
Rebellion? I have to think about that one a moment. But
when I remember the other couples, standing stiffly apart,
never touching or acknowledging each other, as if their fellow
tribute did not exist, as if the Games had already begun, I
know what Haymitch means. Presenting ourselves not as adversaries
but as friends has distinguished us as much as the
fiery costumes.
Tomorrow morning is the first training session. Meet me
for breakfast and I’ll tell you exactly how I want you to play
it, says Haymitch to Peeta and I. Now go get some sleep
while the grown-ups talk.
Peeta and I walk together down the corridor to our rooms.
When we get to my door, he leans against the frame, not
blocking my entrance exactly but insisting I pay attention to
him. So, Delly Cartwright. Imagine finding her lookalike
here.
He’s asking for an explanation, and I’m tempted to give him
one. We both know he covered for me. So here I am in his debt
again. If I tell him the truth about the girl, somehow that might
even things up. How can it hurt really? Even if he repeated the
story, it couldn’t do me much harm. It was just something I
witnessed. And he lied as much as I did about Delly
Cartwright.
I realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl. Someone
who might be able to help me figure out her story.
80
Gale would be my first choice, but it’s unlikely I’ll ever see
Gale again. I try to think if telling Peeta could give him any
possible advantage over me, but I don’t see how. Maybe sharing
a confidence will actually make him believe I see him as a
friend.
Besides, the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens
me. She has reminded me why I’m here. Not to model
flashy costumes and eat delicacies. But to die a bloody death
while the crowds urge on my killer.
To tell or not to tell? My brain still feels slow from the wine.
I stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there.
Peeta picks up on my hesitation. Have you been on the
roof yet? I shake my head. Cinna showed me. You can practically
see the whole city. The wind’s a bit loud, though.
I translate this into No one will overhear us talking in my
head. You do have the sense that we might be under surveillance
here. Can we just go up?
Sure, come on, says Peeta. I follow him to a flight of stairs
that lead to the roof. There’s a small dome-shaped room with
a door to the outside. As we step into the cool, windy evening
air, I catch my breath at the view. The Capitol twinkles like a
vast field of fireflies. Electricity in District 12 comes and goes,
usually we only have it a few hours a day. Often the evenings
are spent in candlelight. The only time you can count on it is
when they’re airing the Games or some important government
message on television that it’s mandatory to watch. But
here there would be no shortage. Ever.
81
Peeta and I walk to a railing at the edge of the roof. I look
straight down the side of the building to the street, which is
buzzing with people. You can hear their cars, an occasional
shout, and a strange metallic tinkling. In District 12, we’d all
be thinking about bed right now.
I asked Cinna why they let us up here. Weren’t they worried
that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over
the side? says Peeta.
What’d he say? I ask.
You can’t, says Peeta. He holds out his hand into seemingly
empty space. There’s a sharp zap and he jerks it back.
Some kind of electric field throws you back on the roof.
Always worried about our safety, I say. Even though Cinna
has shown Peeta the roof, I wonder if we’re supposed to be
up here now, so late and alone. I’ve never seen tributes on the
Training Center roof before. But that doesn’t mean we’re not
being taped. Do you think they’re watching us now?
Maybe, he admits. Come see the garden.
On the other side of the dome, they’ve built a garden with
flower beds and potted trees. From the branches hang hundreds
of wind chimes, which account for the tinkling I heard.
Here in the garden, on this windy night, it’s enough to drown
out two people who are trying not to be heard. Peeta looks at
me expectantly.
I pretend to examine a blossom. We were hunting in the
woods one day. Hidden, waiting for game, I whisper.
You and your father? he whispers back.
82
No, my friend Gale. Suddenly all the birds stopped singing
at once. Except one. As if it were giving a warning call. And
then we saw her. I’m sure it was the same girl. A boy was with
her. Their clothes were tattered. They had dark circles under
their eyes from no sleep. They were running as if their lives
depended on it, I say.
For a moment I’m silent, as I remember how the sight of
this strange pair, clearly not from District 12, fleeing through
the woods immobilized us. Later, we wondered if we could
have helped them escape. Perhaps we might have. Concealed
them. If we’d moved quickly. Gale and I were taken by surprise,
yes, but we’re both hunters. We know how animals look
at bay. We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw
them. But we only watched.
The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere, I continue to
Peeta. I mean, one moment the sky was empty and the next it
was there. It didn’t make a sound, but they saw it. A net
dropped down on the girl and carried her up, fast, so fast like
the elevator. They shot some sort of spear through the boy. It
was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well. But
I’m certain he was dead. We heard the girl scream once. The
boy’s name, I think. Then it was gone, the hovercraft. Vanished
into thin air. And the birds began to sing again, as if nothing
had happened.
Did they see you? Peeta asked.
I don’t know. We were under a shelf of rock, I reply.
But I do know. There was a moment, after the birdcall, but
before the hovercraft, where the girl had seen us. She’d locked
83
eyes with me and called out for help. But neither Gale or I had
responded.
You’re shivering, says Peeta.
The wind and the story have blown all the warmth from my
body. The girl’s scream. Had it been her last?
Peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders.
I start to take a step back, but then I let him, deciding for
a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness. A friend
would do that, right?
They were from here? he asks, and he secures a button at
my neck.
I nod. They’d had that Capitol look about them. The boy and
the girl.
Where do you suppose they were going? he asks.
I don’t know that, I say. District 12 is pretty much the end
of the line. Beyond us, there’s only wilderness. If you don’t
count the ruins of District 13 that still smolder from the toxic
bombs. They show it on television occasionally, just to remind
us. Or why they would leave here. Haymitch had called the
Avoxes traitors. Against what? It could only be the Capitol. But
they had everything here. No cause to rebel.
I’d leave here, Peeta blurts out. Then he looks around
nervously. It was loud enough to hear above the chimes. He
laughs. I’d go home now if they let me. But you have to admit,
the food’s prime.
He’s covered again. If that’s all you’d heard it would just
sound like the words of a scared tribute, not someone contemplating
the unquestionable goodness of the Capitol.
84
It’s getting chilly. We better go in, he says. Inside the
dome, it’s warm and bright. His tone is conversational. Your
friend Gale. He’s the one who took your sister away at the
reaping?
Yes. Do you know him? I ask.
Not really. I hear the girls talk about him a lot. I thought he
was your cousin or something. You favor each other, he says.
No, we’re not related, I say.
Peeta nods, unreadable. Did he come to say good-bye to
you?
Yes, I say, observing him carefully. So did your father. He
brought me cookies.
Peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news. But after
watching him lie so smoothly, I don’t give this much weight.
Really? Well, he likes you and your sister. I think he wishes
he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys.
The idea that I might ever have been discussed, around the
dinner table, at the bakery fire, just in passing in Peeta’s house
gives me a start. It must have been when the mother was out
of the room.
He knew your mother when they were kids, says Peeta.
Another surprise. But probably true. Oh, yes. She grew up
in town, I say. It seems impolite to say she never mentioned
the baker except to compliment his bread.
We’re at my door. I give back his jacket. See you in the
morning then.
See you, he says, and walks off down the hall.
85
When I open my door, the redheaded girl is collecting my
unitard and boots from where I left them on the floor before
my shower. I want to apologize for possibly getting her in
trouble earlier. But I remember I’m not supposed to speak to
her unless I’m giving her an order.
Oh, sorry, I say. I was supposed to get those back to Cinna.
I’m sorry. Can you take them to him?
She avoids my eyes, gives a small nod, and heads out the
door.
I’d set out to tell her I was sorry about dinner. But I know
that my apology runs much deeper. That I’m ashamed I never
tried to help her in the woods. That I let the Capitol kill the
boy and mutilate her without lifting a finger.
Just like I was watching the Games.
I kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my
clothes. The shivering hasn’t stopped. Perhaps the girl doesn’t
even remember me. But I know she does. You don’t forget the
face of the person who was your last hope. I pull the covers up
over my head as if this will protect me from the redheaded girl
who can’t speak. But I can feel her eyes staring at me, piercing
through walls and doors and bedding.
I wonder if she’ll enjoy watching me die.
86
My slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams. The face of
the redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier
Hunger Games, with my mother withdrawn and unreachable,
with Prim emaciated and terrified. I bolt up screaming for my
father to run as the mine explodes into a million deadly bits of
light.
Dawn is breaking through the windows. The Capitol has a
misty, haunted air. My head aches and I must have bitten into
the side of my cheek in the night. My tongue probes the
ragged flesh and I taste blood.
Slowly, I drag myself out of bed and into the shower. I arbitrarily
punch buttons on the control board and end up hopping
from foot to foot as alternating jets of icy cold and steaming
hot water assault me. Then I’m deluged in lemony foam
that I have to scrape off with a heavy bristled brush. Oh, well.
At least my blood is flowing.
When I’m dried and moisturized with lotion, I find an outfit
has been left for me at the front of the closet. Tight black
pants, a long-sleeved burgundy tunic, and leather shoes. I put
my hair in the single braid down my back. This is the first time
since the morning of the reaping that I resemble myself. No
87
fancy hair and clothes, no flaming capes. Just me. Looking like
I could be headed for the woods. It calms me.
Haymitch didn’t give us an exact time to meet for break-last
and no one has contacted me this morning, but I’m hungry so I
head down to the dining room, hoping there will be food. I’m
not disappointed. While the table is empty, a long board off to
the side has been laid with at least twenty dishes. A young
man, an Avox, stands at attention by the spread. When I ask if
I can serve myself, he nods assent. I load a plate with eggs,
sausages, batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves, slices
of pale purple melon. As I gorge myself, I watch the sun rise
over the Capitol. I have a second plate of hot grain smothered
in beef stew. Finally, I fill a plate with rolls and sit at the table,
breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot chocolate, the way
Peeta did on the train.
My mind wanders to my mother and Prim. They must be
up. My mother getting their breakfast of mush. Prim milking
her goat before school. Just two mornings ago, I was home.
Can that be right? Yes, just two. And now how empty the
house feels, even from a distance. What did they say last night
about my fiery debut at the Games? Did it give them hope, or
simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twenty-four
tributes circled together, knowing only one could live?
Haymitch and Peeta come in, bid me good morning, fill
their plates. It makes me irritated that Peeta is wearing exactly
the same outfit I am. I need to say something to Cinna. This
twins act is going to blow up in out faces once the Games begin.
Surely, they must know this. Then I remember Haymitch
88
telling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do. If it was
anyone but Cinna, I might be tempted to ignore him. But after
last night’s triumph, I don’t have a lot of room to criticize his
choices.
I’m nervous about the training. There will be three days in
which all the tributes practice together. On the last afternoon,
we’ll each get a chance to perform in private before the Gamemakers.
The thought of meeting the other tributes face-toface
makes me queasy. I turn the roll I have just taken from
the basket over and over in my hands, but my appetite is gone.
When Haymitch has finished several platters of stew, he
pushes back his plate with a sigh. He takes a flask from his
pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the
table. So, let’s get down to business. Training. First off, if you
like, I’ll coach you separately. Decide now.
Why would you coach us separately? I ask.
Say if you had a secret skill you might not want the other
to know about, says Haymitch.
I exchange a look with Peeta. I don’t have any secret
skills, he says. And I already know what yours is, right? I
mean, I’ve eaten enough of your squirrels.
I never thought about Peeta eating the squirrels I shot.
Somehow I always pictured the baker quietly going off and
frying them up for himself. Not out of greed. But because town
families usually eat expensive butcher meat. Beef and chicken
and horse.
You can coach us together, I tell Haymitch. Peeta nods.
89
All right, so give me some idea of what you can do, says
Haymitch.
I can’t do anything, says Peeta. Unless you count baking
bread.
Sorry, I don’t. Katniss. I already know you’re handy with a
knife, says Haymitch.
Not really. But I can hunt, I say. With a bow and arrow.
And you’re good? asks Haymitch.
I have to think about it. I’ve been putting food on the table
for four years. That’s no small task. I’m not as good as my father
was, but he’d had more practice. I’ve better aim than
Gale, but I’ve had more practice. He’s a genius with traps and
snares. I’m all right, I say.
She’s excellent, says Peeta. My father buys her squirrels.
He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the
body. She hits every one in the eye. It’s the same with the rabbits
she sells the butcher. She can even bring down deer.
This assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me totally by
surprise. First, that he ever noticed. Second, that he’s talking
me up. What are you doing? I ask him suspiciously.
What are you doing? If he’s going to help you, he has to
know what you’re capable of. Don’t underrate yourself, says
Peeta.
I don’t know why, but this rubs me the wrong way. What
about you? I’ve seen you in the market. You can lift hundredpound
bags of flour, I snap at him. Tell him that. That’s not
nothing.
90
Yes, and I’m sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for
me to chuck at people. It’s not like being able to use a weapon.
You know it isn’t, he shoots back.
He can wrestle, I tell Haymitch. He came in second in our
school competition last year, only after his brother.
What use is that? How many times have you seen someone
wrestle someone to death? says Peeta in disgust.
There’s always hand-to-hand combat. All you need is to
come up with a knife, and you’ll at least stand a chance. If I get
jumped, I’m dead! I can hear my voice rising in anger.
But you won’t! You’ll be living up in some tree eating raw
squirrels and picking off people with arrows. You know what
my mother said to me when she came to say good-bye, as if to
cheer me up, she says maybe District Twelve will finally have
a winner. Then I realized, she didn’t mean me, she meant
you! bursts out Peeta.
Oh, she meant you, I say with a wave of dismissal.
She said, ‘She’s a survivor, that one.’ She is, says Peeta.
That pulls me up short. Did his mother really say that about
me? Did she rate me over her son? I see the pain in Peeta’s
eyes and know he isn’t lying.
Suddenly I’m behind the bakery and I can feel the chill of
the rain running down my back, the hollowness in my belly. I
sound eleven years old when I speak. But only because
someone helped me.
Peeta’s eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands, and I
know he remembers that day, too. But he just shrugs. People
91
will help you in the arena. They’ll be tripping over each other
to sponsor you.
No more than you, I say.
Peeta rolls his eyes at Haymitch. She has no idea. The effect
she can have. He runs his fingernail along the wood grain
in the table, refusing to look at me.
What on earth does he mean? People help me? When we
were dying of starvation, no one helped me! No one except
Peeta. Once I had something to barter with, things changed.
I’m a tough trader. Or am I? What effect do I have? That I’m
weak and needy? Is he suggesting that I got good deals because
people pitied me? I try to think if this is true. Perhaps
some of the merchants were a little generous in their trades,
but I always attributed that to their long-standing relationship
with my father. Besides, my game is first-class. No one pitied
me!
I glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me.
After about a minute of this, Haymitch says, Well, then.
Well, well, well. Katniss, there’s no guarantee they’ll be bows
and arrows in the arena, but during your private session with
the Gamemakers, show them what you can do. Until then, stay
clear of archery. Are you any good at trapping?
I know a few basic snares, I mutter.
That may be significant in terms of food, says Haymitch.
And Peeta, she’s right, never underestimate strength in the
arena. Very often, physical power tilts the advantage to a
player. In the Training Center, they will have weights, but
don’t reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tri-
92
butes. The plan’s the same for both of you. You go to group
training. Spend the time trying to learn something you don’t
know. Throw a spear. Swing a mace. Learn to tie a decent
knot. Save showing what you’re best at until your private sessions.
Are we clear? says Haymitch. Peeta and I nod.
One last thing. In public, I want you by each other’s side
every minute, says Haymitch. We both start to object, but
Haymitch slams his hand on the table. Every minute! It’s not
open for discussion! You agreed to do as I said! You will be together,
you will appear amiable to each other. Now get out.
Meet Effie at the elevator at ten for training.
I bite my lip and stalk back to my room, making sure Peeta
can hear the door slam. I sit on the bed, hating Haymitch, hating
Peeta, hating myself for mentioning that day long ago in
the rain.
It’s such a joke! Peeta and I going along pretending to be
friends! Talking up each other’s strengths, insisting the other
take credit for their abilities. Because, in fact, at some point,
we’re going to have to knock it off and accept we’re bitter adversaries.
Which I’d be prepared to do right now if it wasn’t
for Haymitch’s stupid instruction that we stick together in
training. It’s my own fault, I guess, for telling him he didn’t
have to coach us separately. But that didn’t mean I wanted to
do everything with Peeta. Who, by the way, clearly doesn’t
want to be partnering up with me, either.
I hear Peeta’s voice in my head. She has no idea. The effect
she can have. Obviously meant to demean me. Right? but a tiny
part of me wonders if this was a compliment. That he meant I
93
was appealing in some way. It’s weird, how much he’s noticed
me. Like the attention he’s paid to my hunting. And apparently,
I have not been as oblivious to him as I imagined, either.
The flour. The wrestling. I have kept track of the boy with the
bread.
It’s almost ten. I clean my teeth and smooth back my hair
again. Anger temporarily blocked out my nervousness about
meeting the other tributes, but now I can feel my anxiety rising
again. By the time I meet Effie and Peeta at the elevator, I
catch myself biting my nails. I stop at once.
The actual training rooms are below ground level of our
building. With these elevators, the ride is less than a minute.
The doors open into an enormous gymnasium filled with various
weapons and obstacle courses. Although it’s not yet ten,
we’re the last ones to arrive. The other tributes are gathered
in a tense circle. They each have a cloth square with their district
number on it pinned to their shirts. While someone pins
the number 12 on my back, I do a quick assessment. Peeta and
I are the only two dressed alike.
As soon as we join the circle, the head trainer, a tall, athletic
woman named Atala steps up and begins to explain the training
schedule. Experts in each skill will remain at their stations.
We will be free to travel from area to area as we choose, per
our mentor’s instructions. Some of the stations teach survival
skills, others fighting techniques. We are forbidden to engage
in any combative exercise with another tribute. There are assistants
on hand if we want to practice with a partner.
94
When Atala begins to read down the list of the skill stations,
my eyes can’t help flitting around to the other tributes.
It’s the first time we’ve been assembled, on level ground, in
simple clothes. My heart sinks. Almost all of the boys and at
least half of the girls are bigger than I am, even though many
of the tributes have never been fed properly. You can see it in
their bones, their skin, the hollow look in their eyes. I may be
smaller naturally, but overall my family’s resourcefulness has
given me an edge in that area. I stand straight, and while I’m
thin, I’m strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined
with the exertion it took to get them have given me a
healthier body than most of those I see around me.
The exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts, the
volunteers, the ones who have been fed and trained throughout
their lives for this moment. The tributes from 1, 2, and 4
traditionally have this look about them. It’s technically against
the rules to train tributes before they reach the Capitol but it
happens every year. In District 12, we call them the Career
Tributes, or just the Careers. And like as not, the winner will
be one of them.
The slight advantage I held coming into the Training Center,
my fiery entrance last night, seems to vanish in the presence
of my competition. The other tributes were jealous of us,
but not because we were amazing, because our stylists were.
Now I see nothing but contempt in the glances of the Career
Tributes. Each must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me.
They project arrogance and brutality. When Atala releases us,
95
they head straight for the deadliest-looking weapons in the
gym and handle them with ease.
I’m thinking that it’s lucky I’m a fast runner when Peeta
nudges my arm and I jump. He is still beside me, per Haymitch’s
instructions. His expression is sober. Where would
you like to start?
I look around at the Career Tributes who are showing off,
clearly trying to intimidate the field. Then at the others, the
underfed, the incompetent, shakily having their first lessons
with a knife or an ax.
Suppose we tie some knots, I say.
Right you are, says Peeta. We cross to an empty station
where the trainer seems pleased to have students. You get the
feeling that the knot-tying class is not the Hunger games hot
spot. When he realizes I know something about snares, he
shows us a simple, excellent trap that will leave a human
competitor dangling by a leg from a tree. We concentrate on
this one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it.
Then we move on to camouflage. Peeta genuinely seems to enjoy
this station, swirling a combination of mud and clay and
berry juices around on his pale skin, weaving disguises from
vines and leaves. The trainer who runs the camouflage station
is full of enthusiasm at his work.
I do the cakes, he admits to me.
The cakes? I ask. I’ve been preoccupied with watching the
boy from District 2 send a spear through a dummy’s heart
from fifteen yards. What cakes?
At home. The iced ones, for the bakery, he says.
96
He means the ones they display in the windows. Fancy
cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in frosting.
They’re for birthdays and New Year’s Day. When we’re in the
square, Prim always drags me over to admire them, although
we’d never be able to afford one. There’s little enough beauty
in District 12, though, so I can hardly deny her this.
I look more critically at the design on Peeta’s arm. The alternating
pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling
through the leaves in the woods. I wonder how he knows this,
since I doubt he’s ever been beyond the fence. Has he been
able to pick this up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his
backyard? Somehow the whole thing — his skill, those inaccessible
cakes, the praise of the camouflage expert — annoys
me.
It’s lovely. If only you could frost someone to death, I say.
Don’t be so superior. You can never tell what you’ll find in
the arena. Say it’s actually a gigantic cake — begins Peeta.
Say we move on, I break in.
So the next three days pass with Peeta and I going quietly
from station to station. We do pick up some valuable skills,
from starting fires, to knife throwing, to making shelter. Despite
Haymitch’s order to appear mediocre, Peeta excels in
hand-to-hand combat, and I sweep the edible plants test without
blinking an eye. We steer clear of archery and weightlifting
though, wanting to save those for our private sessions.
The Gamemakers appeared early on the first day. Twenty
or so men and women dressed in deep purple robes. They sit
in the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium, some-
97
times wandering about to watch us, jotting down notes, other
times eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them,
ignoring the lot of us. But they do seem to be keeping their eye
on the District 12 tributes. Several times I’ve looked up to find
one fixated on me. They consult with the trainers during our
meals as well. We see them all gathered together when we
come back.
Breakfast and dinner are served on our floor, but at lunch
the twenty-four of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium.
Food is arranged on carts around the room and you serve
yourself. The Career Tributes tend to gather rowdily around
one table, as if to prove their superiority, that they have no
fear of one another and consider the rest of us beneath notice.
Most of the other tributes sit alone, like lost sheep. No one
says a word to us. Peeta and I eat together, and since Haymitch
keeps dogging us about it, try to keep up a friendly conversation
during the meals.
It’s not easy to find a topic. Talking of home is painful. Talking
of the present unbearable. One day, Peeta empties our
breadbasket and points out how they have been careful to include
types from the districts along with the refined bread of
the Capitol. The fish-shaped loaf tinted green with seaweed
from District 4. The crescent moon roll dotted with seeds from
District 11. Somehow, although it’s made from the same stuff,
it looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that
are the standard fare at home.
And there you have it, says Peeta, scooping the breads
back in the basket.
98
You certainly know a lot, I say.
Only about bread, he says. Okay, now laugh as if I’ve said
something funny.
We both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore the
stares from around the room.
All right, I’ll keep smiling pleasantly and you talk, says
Peeta. It’s wearing us both out, Haymitch’s direction to be
friendly. Because ever since I slammed my door, there’s been
a chill in the air between us. But we have our orders.
Did I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a bear?
I ask.
No, but it sounds fascinating, says Peeta.
I try and animate my face as I recall the event, a true story,
in which I’d foolishly challenged a black bear over the rights
to a beehive. Peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue.
He’s much better at this than I am.
On the second day, while we’re taking a shot at spear
throwing, he whispers to me. I think we have a shadow.
I throw my spear, which I’m not too bad at actually, if I
don’t have to throw too far, and see the little girl from District
11 standing back a bit, watching us. She’s the twelve-year-old,
the one who reminded me so of Prim in stature. Up close she
looks about ten. She has bright, dark, eyes and satiny brown
skin and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly extended
to her sides, as if ready to take wing at the slightest
sound. It’s impossible not to think of a bird.
I pick up another spear while Peeta throws. I think her
name’s Rue, he says softly.
99
I bite my lip. Rue is a small yellow flower that grows in the
Meadow. Rue. Primrose. Neither of them could tip the scale at
seventy pounds soaking wet.
What can we do about it? I ask him, more harshly than I
intended.
Nothing to do, he says back. Just making conversation.
Now that I know she’s there, it’s hard to ignore the child.
She slips up and joins us at different stations. Like me, she’s
clever with plants, climbs swiftly, and has good aim. She can
hit the target every time with a slingshot. But what is a slingshot
against a 220-pound male with a sword?
Back on the District 12 floor, Haymitch and Effie grill us
throughout breakfast and dinner about every moment of the
day. What we did, who watched us, how the other tributes size
up. Cinna and Portia aren’t around, so there’s no one to add
any sanity to the meals. Not that Haymitch and Effie are fighting
anymore. Instead they seem to be of one mind, determined
to whip us into shape. Full of endless directions about what
we should do and not do in training. Peeta is more patient, but
I become fed up and surly.
When we finally escape to bed on the second night, Peeta
mumbles, Someone ought to get Haymitch a drink.
I make a sound that is somewhere between a snort and a
laugh. Then catch myself. It’s messing with my mind too much,
trying to keep straight when we’re supposedly friends and
when we’re not. At least when we get into the arena, I’ll know
where we stand. Don’t. Don’t let’s pretend when there’s no
one around.
100
All right, Katniss, he says tiredly. After that, we only talk
in front of people.
On the third day of training, they start to call us out of lunch
for our private sessions with the Gamemakers. District by district,
first the boy, then the girl tribute. As usual, District 12 is
slated to go last. We linger in the dining room, unsure where
else to go. No one comes back once they have left. As the room
empties, the pressure to appear friendly lightens. By the time
they call Rue, we are left alone. We sit in silence until they
summon Peeta. He rises.
Remember what Haymitch said about being sure to throw
the weights. The words come out of my mouth without permission.
Thanks. I will, he says. You . . . shoot straight.
I nod. I don’t know why I said anything at all. Although if
I’m going to lose, I’d rather Peeta win than the others. Better
for our district, for my mother and Prim.
After about fifteen minutes, they call my name. I smooth my
hair, set my shoulders back, and walk into the gymnasium. Instantly,
I know I’m in trouble. They’ve been here too long, the
Gamemakers. Sat through twenty-three other demonstrations.
Had too much to wine, most of them. Want more than anything
to go home.
There’s nothing I can do but continue with the plan. I walk
to the archery station. Oh, the weapons! I’ve been itching to
get my hands on them for days! Bows made of wood and plastic
and metal and materials I can’t even name. Arrows with
feathers cut in flawless uniform lines. I choose a bow, string it,
101
and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder.
There’s a shooting range, but it’s much too limited. Standard
bull’s-eyes and human silhouettes. I walk to the center of the
gymnasium and pick my first target. The dummy used for
knife practice. Even as I pull back on the bow I know something
is wrong. The string’s tighter than the one I use at home.
The arrow’s more rigid. I miss the dummy by a couple of inches
and lose what little attention I had been commanding. For a
moment, I’m humiliated, then I head back to the bull’s-eye. I
shoot again and again until I get the feel of these new weapons.
Back in the center of the gymnasium, I take my initial position
and skewer the dummy right through the heart. Then I
sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing, and the bag
splits open as it slams to the ground. Without pausing, I
shoulder-roll forward, come up on one knee, and send an arrow
into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium
floor. A shower of sparks bursts from the fixture.
It’s excellent shooting. I turn to the Gamemakers. A few are
nodding approval, but the majority of them are fixated on a
roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table.
Suddenly I am furious, that with my life on the line, they
don’t even have the decency to pay attention to me. That I’m
being upstaged by a dead pig. My heart starts to pound, I can
feel my face burning. Without thinking, I pull an arrow from
my quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers’ table. I
hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back. The arrow
102
skewers the apple in the pig’s mouth and pins it to the wall
behind it. Everyone stares at me in disbelief.
Thank you for your consideration, I say. Then I give a
slight bow and walk straight toward the exit without being
dismissed.
103
As I stride toward the elevator, I fling my bow to one side
and my quiver to the other. I brush past the gaping Avoxes
who guard the elevators and hit the number twelve button
with my fist. The doors slide together and I zip upward. I actually
make it back to my floor before the tears start running
down my cheeks. I can hear the others calling me from the sitting
room, but I fly down the hall into my room, bolt the door,
and fling myself onto my bed. Then I really begin to sob.
Now I’ve done it! Now I’ve ruined everything! If I’d stood
even a ghost of chance, it vanished when I sent that arrow flying
at the Gamemakers. What will they do to me now? Arrest
me? Execute me? Cut my tongue and turn me into an Avox so I
can wait on the future tributes of Panem? What was I thinking,
shooting at the Gamemakers? Of course, I wasn’t, I was shooting
at that apple because I was so angry at being ignored. I
wasn’t trying to kill one of them. If I were, they’d be dead!
Oh, what does it matter? It’s not like I was going to win the
Games anyway. Who cares what they do to me? What really
scares me is what they might do to my mother and Prim, how
my family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness. Will
they take their few belongings, or send my mother to prison
104
and Prim to the community home, or kill them? They wouldn’t
kill them, would they? Why not? What do they care?
I should have stayed and apologized. Or laughed, like it was
a big joke. Then maybe I would have found some leniency. But
instead I stalked out of the place in the most disrespectful
manner possible.
Haymitch and Effie are knocking on my door. I shout for
them to go away and eventually they do. It takes at least an
hour for me to cry myself out. Then I just lay curled up on the
bed, stroking the silken sheets, watching the sun set over the
artificial candy Capitol.
At first, I expect guards to come for me. But as time passes,
it seems less likely. I calm down. They still need a girl tribute
from District 12, don’t they? If the Gamemakers want to punish
me, they can do it publicly. Wait until I’m in the arena and
sic starving wild animals on me. You can bet they’ll make sure
I don’t have a bow and arrow to defend myself.
Before that though, they’ll give me a score so low, no one in
their right mind would sponsor me. That’s what will happen
tonight. Since the training isn’t open to viewers, the Gamemakers
announce a score for each player. It gives the audience
a starting place for the betting that will continue throughout
the Games. The number, which is between one and twelve,
one being irredeemably bad and twelve being unattainably
high, signifies the promise of the tribute. The mark is not a
guarantee of which person will win. It’s only an indication of
the potential a tribute showed in training. Often, because of
the variables in the actual arena, high-scoring tributes go
105
down almost immediately. And a few years ago, the boy who
won the Games only received a three. Still, the scores can help
or hurt an individual tribute in terms of sponsorship. I had
been hoping my shooting skills might get me a six or a seven,
even if I’m not particularly powerful. Now I’m sure I’ll have
the lowest score of the twenty-four. If no one sponsors me, my
odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero.
When Effie taps on the door to call me to dinner, I decide I
may as well go. The scores will be televised tonight. It’s not
like I can hide what happened forever. I go to the bathroom
and wash my face, but it’s still red and splotchy.
Everyone’s waiting at the table, even Cinna and Portia. I
wish the stylists hadn’t shown up because for some reason, I
don’t like the idea of disappointing them. It’s as if I’ve thrown
away all the good work they did on the opening ceremonies
without a thought. I avoid looking at anyone as I take tiny
spoonfuls of fish soup. The saltiness reminds me of my tears.
The adults begin some chitchat about the weather forecast,
and I let my eyes meet Peeta’s. He raises his eyebrows. A question.
What happened? I just give my head a small shake. Then,
as they’re serving the main course, I hear Haymitch say,
Okay, enough small talk, just how bad were you today?
Peeta jumps in. I don’t know that it mattered. By the time I
showed up, no one even bothered to look at me. They were
singing some kind of drinking song, I think. So, I threw around
some heavy objects until they told me I could go.
That makes me feel a bit better. It’s not like Peeta attacked
the Gamemakers, but at least he was provoked, too.
106
And you, sweetheart? says Haymitch.
Somehow Haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me off
enough that I’m at least able to speak. I shot an arrow at the
Gamemakers.
Everyone stops eating. You what? The horror in Effie’s
voice confirms my worse suspicions.
I shot an arrow at them. Not exactly at them. In their direction.
It’s like Peeta said, I was shooting and they were ignoring
me and I just . . . I just lost my head, so I shot an apple out of
their stupid roast pig’s mouth! I say defiantly.
And what did they say? says Cinna carefully.
Nothing. Or I don’t know. I walked out after that, I say.
Without being dismissed? gasps Effie.
I dismissed myself, I said. I remember how I promised
Prim that I really would try to win and I feel like a ton of coal
has dropped on me.
Well, that’s that, says Haymitch. Then he butters a roll.
Do you think they’ll arrest me? I ask. Doubt it. Be a pain
to replace you at this stage, says Haymitch.
What about my family? I say. Will they punish them?
Don’t think so. Wouldn’t make much sense. See they’d
have to reveal what happened in the Training Center for it to
have any worthwhile effect on the population. People would
need to know what you did. But they can’t since it’s secret, so
it’d be a waste of effort, says Haymitch. More likely they’ll
make your life hell in the arena.
Well, they’ve already promised to do that to us any way,
says Peeta.
107
Very true, says Haymitch. And I realize the impossible has
happened. They have actually cheered me up. Haymitch picks
up a pork chop with his fingers, which makes Effie frown, and
dunks it in his wine. He rips off a hunk of meat and starts to
chuckle. What were their faces like?
I can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up. Shocked. Terrified.
Uh, ridiculous, some of them. An image pops into my
mind. One man tripped backward into a bowl of punch.
Haymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except Effie, although
even she is suppressing a smile. Well, it serves them
right. It’s their job to pay attention to you. And just because
you come from District Twelve is no excuse to ignore you.
Then her eyes dart around as if she’s said something totally
outrageous. I’m sorry, but that’s what I think, she says to no
one in particular.
I’ll get a very bad score, I say.
Scores only matter if they’re very good, no one pays much
attention to the bad or mediocre ones. For all they know, you
could be hiding your talents to get a low score on purpose.
People use that strategy, said Portia.
I hope that’s how people interpret the four I’ll probably
get, says Peeta. If that. Really, is anything less impressive
than watching a person pick up a heavy ball and throw it a
couple of yards. One almost landed on my foot.
I grin at him and realize that I’m starving. I cut off a piece of
pork, dunk it in mashed potatoes, and start eating. It’s okay.
My family is safe. And if they are safe, no real harm has been
done.
108
After dinner, we go to sitting room to watch the scores announced
on television. First they show a photo of the tribute,
then flash their score below it. The Career Tributes naturally
get in the eight-to-ten range. Most of the other players average
a five. Surprisingly, little Rue comes up with a seven. I
don’t know what she showed the judges, but she’s so tiny it
must have been impressive.
District 12 comes up last, as usual. Peeta pulls an eight so at
least a couple of the Gamemakers must have been watching
him. I dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up,
expecting the worst. Then they’re flashing the number eleven
on the screen.
Eleven!
Effie Trinket lets out a squeal, and everybody is slapping
me on the back and cheering and congratulating me. But it
doesn’t seem real.
There must be a mistake. How . . . how could that happen?
I ask Haymitch.
Guess they liked your temper, he says. They’ve got a
show to put on. They need some players with some heat.
Katniss, the girl who was on fire, says Cinna and gives me
a hug. Oh, wait until you see your interview dress. More
flames? I ask. Of a sort, he says mischievously.
Peeta and I congratulate each other, another awkward
moment. We’ve both done well, but what does that mean for
the other? I escape to my room as quickly as possible and burrow
down under the covers. The stress of the day, particularly
109
the crying, has worn me out. I drift off, reprieved, relieved,
and with the number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids.
At dawn, I lie in bed for a while, watching the sun come up
on a beautiful morning. It’s Sunday. A day off at home. I wonder
if Gale is in the woods yet. Usually we devote all of Sunday
to stocking up for the week. Rising early, hunting and gathering,
then trading at the Hob. I think of Gale without me. Both
of us can hunt alone, but we’re better as a pair. Particularly if
we’re trying for bigger game. But also in the littler things, having
a partner lightened the load, could even make the arduous
task of filling my family’s table enjoyable.
I had been struggling along on my own for about six
months when I first ran into Gale in the woods. It was a Sunday
in October, the air cool and pungent with dying things. I’d
spent the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and
the slightly warmer afternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting
katniss. The only meat I’d shot was a squirrel that had
practically run over my toes in its quest for acorns, but the animals
would still be afoot when the snow buried my other
food sources. Having strayed farther afield than usual, I was
hurrying back home, lugging my burlap sacks when I came
across a dead rabbit. It was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a
foot above my head. About fifteen yards away was another. I
recognized the twitch-up snares because my father had used
them. When the prey is caught, it’s yanked into the air out of
the reach of other hungry animals. I’d been trying to use
snares all summer with no success, so I couldn’t help dropping
my sacks to examine this one. My fingers were just on the wire
110
above one of the rabbits when a voice rang out. That’s dangerous.
I jumped back several feet as Gale materialized from behind
a tree. He must have been watching me the whole time.
He was only fourteen, but he cleared six feet and was as good
as an adult to me. I’d seen him around the Seam and at school.
And one other time. He’d lost his father in the same blast that
killed mine. In January, I’d stood by while he received his
medal of valor in the Justice Building, another oldest child
with no father. I remembered his two little brothers clutching
his mother, a woman whose swollen belly announced she was
just days away from giving birth.
What’s your name? he said, coming over and disengaging
the rabbit from the snare. He had another three hanging from
his belt.
Katniss, I said, barely audible.
Well, Catnip, stealing’s punishable by death, or hadn’t you
heard? he said.
Katniss, I said louder. And I wasn’t stealing it. I just
wanted to look at your snare. Mine never catch anything.
He scowled at me, not convinced. So where’d you get the
squirrel?
I shot it. I pulled my bow off my shoulder. I was still using
the small version my father had made me, but I’d been practicing
with the full-size one when I could. I was hoping that by
spring I might be able to bring down some bigger game.
Gale’s eyes fastened on the bow. Can I see that? I handed
it over. Just remember, stealing’s punishable by death.
111
That was the first time I ever saw him smile. It transformed
him from someone menacing to someone you wished you
knew. But it took several months before I returned that smile.
We talked hunting then. I told him I might be able to get
him a bow if he had something to trade. Not food. I wanted
knowledge. I wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt
of fat rabbits in one day. He agreed something might be
worked out. As the seasons went by, we grudgingly began to
share our knowledge, our weapons, our secret places that
were thick with wild plums or turkeys. He taught me snares
and fishing. I showed him what plants to eat and eventually
gave him one of our precious bows. And then one day, without
either of us saying it, we became a team. Dividing the work
and the spoils. Making sure that both our families had food.
Gale gave me a sense of security I’d lacked since my father’s
death. His companionship replaced the long solitary hours in
the woods. I became a much better hunter when I didn’t have
to look over my shoulder constantly, when someone was
watching my back. But he turned into so much more than a
hunting partner. He became my confidante, someone with
whom I could share thoughts I could never voice inside the
fence. In exchange, he trusted me with his. Being out in the
woods with Gale . . . sometimes I was actually happy.
I call him my friend, but in the last year it’s seemed too casual
a word for what Gale is to me. A pang of longing shoots
through my chest. If only he was with me now! But, of course,
I don’t want that. I don’t want him in the arena where he’d be
112
dead in a few days. I just . . . I just miss him. And I hate being
so alone. Does he miss me? He must.
I think of the eleven flashing under my name last night. I
know exactly what he’d say to me. Well, there’s some room
for improvement there. And then he’d give me a smile and I’d
return it without hesitating now.
I can’t help comparing what I have with Gale to what I’m
pretending to have with Peeta. How I never question Gale’s
motives while I do nothing but doubt the latter’s. It’s not a fair
comparison really. Gale and I were thrown together by a mutual
need to survive. Peeta and I know the other’s survival
means our own death. How do you sidestep that?
Effie’s knocking at the door, reminding me there’s another
big, big, big day! ahead. Tomorrow night will be our televised
interviews. I guess the whole team will have their hands
full readying us for that.
I get up and take a quick shower, being a bit more careful
about the buttons I hit, and head down to the dining room.
Peeta, Effie, and Haymitch are huddled around the table talking
in hushed voices. That seems odd, but hunger wins out
over curiosity and I load up my plate with breakfast before I
join them.
The stew’s made with tender chunks of lamb and dried
plums today. Perfect on the bed of wild rice. I’ve shoveled
about halfway through the mound when I realize no one’s
talking. I take a big gulp of orange juice and wipe my mouth.
So, what’s going on? You’re coaching us on interviews today,
right?
113
That’s right, says Haymitch.
You don’t have to wait until I’m done. I can listen and cat
at the same time, I say.
Well, there’s been a change of plans. About our current
approach, says Haymitch.
What’s that? I ask. I’m not sure what our current approach
is. Trying to appear mediocre in front of the other tributes
is the last bit of strategy I remember.
Haymitch shrugs. Peeta has asked to be coached separately.
114
Betrayal. That’s the first thing I feel, which is ludicrous. For
there to be betrayal, there would have had to been trust first.
Between Peeta and me. And trust has not been part of the
agreement. We’re tributes. But the boy who risked a beating
to give me bread, the one who steadied me in the chariot, who
covered for me with the redheaded Avox girl, who insisted
Haymitch know my hunting skills . . . was there some part of
me that couldn’t help trusting him?
On the other hand, I’m relieved that we can stop the pretense
of being friends. Obviously, whatever thin connection
we’d foolishly formed has been severed. And high time, too.
The Games begin in two days, and trust will only be a weakness.
Whatever triggered Peeta’s decision — and I suspect it
had to do with my outperforming him in training — I should
be nothing but grateful for it. Maybe he’s finally accepted the
fact that the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are enemies,
the better.
Good, I say. So what’s the schedule?
You’ll each have four hours with Effie for presentation and
four with me for content, says Haymitch. You start with Effie,
Katniss.
115
I can’t imagine what Effie will have to teach me that could
take four hours, but she’s got me working down to the last
minute. We go to my rooms and she puts me in a full-length
gown and high-heeled shoes, not the ones I’ll he wearing for
the actual interview, and instructs me on walking. The shoes
are the worst part. I’ve never worn high heels and can’t get
used to essentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet.
But Effie runs around in them full-time, and I’m determined
that if she can do it, so can I. The dress poses another problem.
It keeps tangling around my shoes so, of course, I hitch it up,
and then Effie swoops down on me like a hawk, smacking my
hands and yelling, Not above the ankle! When I finally conquer
walking, there’s still sitting, posture — apparently I have
a tendency to duck my head — eye contact, hand gestures, and
smiling. Smiling is mostly about smiling more. Effie makes me
say a hundred banal phrases starting with a smile, while smiling,
or ending with a smile. By lunch, the muscles in my cheeks
are twitching from overuse.
Well, that’s the best I can do, Effie says with a sigh. Just
remember, Katniss, you want the audience to like you.
And you don’t think they will? I ask.
Not if you glare at them the entire time. Why don’t you
save that for the arena? Instead, think of yourself among
friends, says Effie.
They’re betting on how long I’ll live! I burst out. They’re
not my friends!
116
Well, try and pretend! snaps Effie. Then she composes
herself and beams at me. See, like this. I’m smiling at you
even though you’re aggravating me.
Yes, it feels very convincing, I say. I’m going to eat. 1
kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining room, hiking
my skirt up to my thighs.
Peeta and Haymitch seem in pretty good moods, so I’m
thinking the content session should be an improvement over
the morning. I couldn’t be more wrong. After lunch, Haymitch
takes me into the sitting room, directs me to the couch, and
then just frowns at me for a while.
What? I finally ask.
I’m trying to figure out what to do with you, he says.
How we’re going to present you. Are you going to be charming?
Aloof? Fierce? So far, you’re shining like a star. You volunteered
to save your sister. Cinna made you look unforgettable.
You’ve got the top training score. People are intrigued, but no
one knows who you are. The impression you make tomorrow
will decide exactly what I can get you in terms of sponsors,
says Haymitch.
Having watched the tribute interviews all my life, I know
there’s truth to what he’s saying. If you appeal to the crowd,
either by being humorous or brutal or eccentric, you gain favor.
What’s Peeta’s approach? Or am I not allowed to ask? I
say.
117
Likable. He has a sort of self-deprecating humor naturally,
says Haymitch. Whereas when you open your mouth, you
come across more as sullen and hostile.
I do not! I say.
Please. I don’t know where you pulled that cheery, wavy
girl on the chariot from, but I haven’t seen her before or
since, says Haymitch.
And you’ve given me so many reasons to be cheery, I
counter.
But you don’t have to please me. I’m not going to sponsor
you. So pretend I’m the audience, says Haymitch. Delight
me.
Fine! I snarl. Haymitch takes the role of the interviewer
and I try to answer his questions in a winning fashion. But I
can’t. I’m too angry with Haymitch for what he said and that I
even have to answer the questions. All I can think is how unjust
the whole thing is, the Hunger Games. Why am I hopping
around like some trained dog trying to please people I hate?
The longer the interview goes on, the more my fury seems to
rise to the surface, until I’m literally spitting out answers at
him.
All right, enough, he says. We’ve got to find another angle.
Not only are you hostile, I don’t know anything about you.
I’ve asked you fifty questions and still have no sense of your
life, your family, what you care about. They want to know
about you, Katniss.
118
But I don’t want them to! They’re already taking my future!
They can’t have the things that mattered to me in the
past! I say.
Then lie! Make something up! says Haymitch.
I’m not good at lying, I say.
Well, you better learn fast. You’ve got about as much
charm as a dead slug, says Haymitch.
Ouch. That hurts. Even Haymitch must know he’s been too
harsh because his voice softens. Here’s an idea. Try acting
humble.
Humble, I echo.
That you can’t believe a little girl from District Twelve has
done this well. The whole thing’s been more than you ever
could have dreamed of. Talk about Cinna’s clothes. How nice
the people are. How the city amazes you. If you won’t talk
about yourself, at least compliment the audience. Just keep
turning it back around, all right. Gush.
The next hours are agonizing. At once, it’s clear I cannot
gush. We try me playing cocky, but I just don’t have the arrogance.
Apparently, I’m too vulnerable for ferocity. I’m not witty.
Funny. Sexy. Or mysterious.
By the end of the session, I am no one at all. Haymitch
started drinking somewhere around witty, and a nasty edge
has crept into his voice. I give up, sweetheart. Just answer the
questions and try not to let the audience see how openly you
despise them.
I have dinner that night in my room, ordering an outrageous
number of delicacies, eating myself sick, and then tak-
119
ing out my anger at Haymitch, at the Hunger Games, at every
living being in the Capitol by smashing dishes around my
room. When the girl with the red hair comes in to turn down
my bed, her eyes widen at the mess. Just leave it! I yell at
her. Just leave it alone!
I hate her, too, with her knowing reproachful eyes that call
me a coward, a monster, a puppet of the Capitol, both now and
then. For her, justice must finally be happening. At least my
death will help pay for the life of the boy in the woods.
But instead of fleeing the room, the girl closes the door behind
her and goes to the bathroom. She comes back with a
damp cloth and wipes my face gently then cleans the blood
from a broken plate off my hands. Why is she doing this? Why
am I letting her?
I should have tried to save you, I whisper.
She shakes her head. Does this mean we were right to stand
by? That she has forgiven me?
No, it was wrong, I say.
She taps her lips with her fingers then points to my chest. I
think she means that I would just have ended up an Avox, too.
Probably would have. An Avox or dead.
I spend the next hour helping the redheaded girl clean the
room. When all the garbage has been dropped down a disposal
and the food cleaned away, she turns down my bed. I crawl
in between the sheets like a five-year-old and let her tuck me
in. Then she goes. I want her to stay until I fall asleep. To be
there when I wake up. I want the protection of this girl, even
though she never had mine.
120
In the morning, it’s not the girl but my prep team who are
hanging over me. My lessons with Effie and Haymitch are
over. This day belongs to Cinna. He’s my last hope. Maybe he
can make me look so wonderful, no one will care what comes
out of my mouth.
The team works on me until late afternoon, turning my skin
to glowing satin, stenciling patterns on my arms, painting
flame designs on my twenty perfect nails. Then Venia goes to
work on my hair, weaving strands of red into a pattern that
begins at my left ear, wraps around my head, and then falls in
one braid down my right shoulder. They erase my face with a
layer of pale makeup and draw my features back out. Huge
dark eyes, full red lips, lashes that throw off bits of light when
I blink. Finally, they cover my entire body in a powder that
makes me shimmer in gold dust.
Then Cinna enters with what I assume is my dress, but I
can’t really see it because it’s covered. Close your eyes, he
orders.
I can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over my
naked body, then the weight. It must be forty pounds. I clutch
Octavia’s hand as I blindly step into my shoes, glad to find
they are at least two inches lower than the pair Effie had me
practice in. There’s some adjusting and fidgeting. Then silence.
Can I open my eyes? I ask.
Yes, says Cinna. Open them.
The creature standing before me in the full-length mirror
has come from another world. Where skin shimmers and eyes
121
flash and apparently they make their clothes from jewels. Because
my dress, oh, my dress is entirely covered in reflective
precious gems, red and yellow and white with bits of blue that
accent the tips of the flame design. The slightest movement
gives the impression I am engulfed in tongues of fire.
I am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as the
sun.
For a while, we all just stare at me. Oh, Cinna, I finally
whisper. Thank you.
Twirl for me, he says. I hold out my arms and spin in a
circle. The prep team screams in admiration.
Cinna dismisses the team and has me move around in the
dress and shoes, which are infinitely more manageable than
Effie’s. The dress hangs in such a way that I don’t have to lift
the skirt when I walk, leaving me with one less thing to worry
about.
So, all ready for the interview then? asks Cinna. I can see
by his expression that he’s been talking to Haymitch. That he
knows how dreadful I am.
I’m awful. Haymitch called me a dead slug. No matter what
we tried, I couldn’t do it. I just can’t be one of those people he
wants me to be, I say.
Cinna thinks about this a moment. Why don’t you just be
yourself?
Myself? That’s no good, either. Haymitch says I’m sullen
and hostile, I say.
Well, you are . . . around Haymitch, says Cinna with a grin.
I don’t find you so. The prep team adores you. You even won
122
over the Gamemakers. And as for the citizens of the Capitol,
well, they can’t stop talking about you. No one can help but
admire your spirit.
My spirit. This is a new thought. I’m not sure exactly what it
means, but it suggests I’m a fighter. In a sort of brave way. It’s
not as if I’m never friendly. Okay, maybe I don’t go around loving
everybody I meet, maybe my smiles are hard to come by,
but I do care for some people.
Cinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones. Suppose, when
you answer the questions, you think you’re addressing a
friend back home. Who would your best friend be? asks Cinna.
Gale, I say instantly. Only it doesn’t make sense, Cinna. I
would never be telling Gale those things about me. He already
knows them.
What about me? Could you think of me as a friend? asks
Cinna.
Of all the people I’ve met since I left home, Cinna is by far
my favorite. I liked him right off and he hasn’t disappointed
me yet. I think so, but —
I’ll be sitting on the main platform with the other stylists.
You’ll be able to look right at me. When you’re asked a question,
find me, and answer it as honestly as possible, says Cinna.
Even if what I think is horrible? I ask. Because it might be,
really.
Especially if what you think is horrible, says Cinna. You’ll
try it?
123
I nod. It’s a plan. Or at least a straw to grasp at.
Too soon it’s time to go. The interviews take place on a
stage constructed in front of the Training Center. Once I leave
my room, it will be only minutes until I’m in front of the
crowd, the cameras, all of Panem.
As Cinna turns the doorknob, I stop his hand. Cinna . . . I’m
completely overcome with stage fright.
Remember, they already love you, he says gently. Just be
yourself.
We meet up with the rest of the District 12 crowd at the
elevator. Portia and her gang have been hard at work. Peeta
looks striking in a black suit with flame accents. While we look
well together, it’s a relief not to be dressed identically. Haymitch
and Effie are all fancied up for the occasion. I avoid
Haymitch, but accept Effie’s compliments. Effie can be tiresome
and clueless, but she’s not destructive like Haymitch.
When the elevator opens, the other tributes are being lined
up to take the stage. All twenty-four of us sit in a big arc
throughout the interviews. I’ll be last, or second to last since
the girl tribute precedes the boy from each district. How I
wish I could be first and get the whole thing out of the way!
Now I’ll have to listen to how witty, funny, humble, fierce, and
charming everybody else is before I go up. Plus, the audience
will start to get bored, just as the Gamemakers did. And I can’t
exactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to get their attention.
Right before we parade onto the stage, Haymitch comes up
behind Peeta and me and growls, Remember, you’re still a
happy pair. So act like it.
124
What? I thought we abandoned that when Peeta asked for
separate coaching. But I guess that was a private, not a public
thing. Anyway, there’s not much chance for interaction now,
as we walk single-file to our seats and take our places.
Just stepping on the stage makes my breathing rapid and
shallow. I can feel my pulse pounding in my temples. It’s a relief
to get to my chair, because between the heels and my legs
shaking, I’m afraid I’ll trip. Although evening is falling, the City
Circle is brighter than a summer’s day. An elevated seating
unit has been set up for prestigious guests, with the stylists
commanding the front row. The cameras will turn to them
when the crowd is reacting to their handiwork. A large balcony
off a building to the right has been reserved for the Gamemakers.
Television crews have claimed most of the other balconies.
But the City Circle and the avenues that feed into it are
completely packed with people. Standing room only. At homes
and community halls around the country, every television set
is turned on. Every citizen of Panem is tuned in. There will be
no blackouts tonight.
Caesar Flickerman, the man who has hosted the interviews
for more than forty years, bounces onto the stage. It’s a little
scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged
during all that time. Same face under a coating of pure white
makeup. Same hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each
Hunger Games. Same ceremonial suit, midnight blue dotted
with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars.
They do surgery in the Capitol, to make people appear younger
and thinner. In District 12, looking old is something of an
125
achievement since so many people die early. You see an elderly
person you want to congratulate them on their longevity,
ask the secret of survival. A plump person is envied because
they aren’t scraping by like the majority of us. But here it is
different. Wrinkles aren’t desirable. A round belly isn’t a sign
of success.
This year, Caesar’s hair is powder blue and his eyelids and
lips are coated in the same hue. He looks freakish but less
frightening than he did last year when his color was crimson
and he seemed to be bleeding. Caesar tells a few jokes to
warm up the audience but then gets down to business.
The girl tribute from District 1, looking provocative in a
see-through gold gown, steps up the center of the stage to join
Caesar for her interview. You can tell her mentor didn’t have
any trouble coming up with an angle for her. With that flowing
blonde hair, emerald green eyes, her body tall and lush . . .
she’s sexy all the way.
Each interview only lasts three minutes. Then a buzzer
goes off and the next tribute is up. I’ll say this for Caesar, he
really does his best to make the tributes shine. He’s friendly,
tries to set the nervous ones at ease, laughs at lame jokes, and
can turn a weak response into a memorable one by the way he
reacts.
I sit like a lady, the way Effie showed me, as the districts
slip by. 2, 3, 4. Everyone seems to be playing up some angle.
The monstrous boy from District 2 is a ruthless killing machine.
The fox-faced girl from District 5 sly and elusive. I spotted
Cinna as soon as he took his place, but even his presence
126
cannot relax me. 8, 9, 10. The crippled boy from 10 is very
quiet. My palms are sweating like crazy, but the jeweled dress
isn’t absorbent and they skid right of if I try to dry them. 11.
Rue, who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete with
wings, flutters her way to Caesar. A hush falls over the crowd
at the sight of this magical wisp of a tribute. Caesar’s very
sweet with her, complimenting her seven in training, an excellent
score for one so small. When he asks her what her greatest
strength in the arena will be, she doesn’t hesitate. I’m
very hard to catch, she says in a tremulous voice. And if they
can’t catch me, they can’t kill me. So don’t count me out.
I wouldn’t in a million years, says Caesar encouragingly.
The boy tribute from District 11, Thresh, has the same dark
skin as Rue, but the resemblance stops there. He’s one of the
giants, probably six and a half feet tall and built like an ox, but
I noticed he rejected the invitations from the Career Tributes
to join their crowd. Instead he’s been very solitary, speaking
to no one, showing little interest in training. Even so, he
scored a ten and it’s not hard to imagine he impressed the
Gamemakers. He ignores Caesar’s attempts at banter and answers
with a yes or no or just remains silent.
If only I was his size, I could get away with sullen and hostile
and it would be just fine! I bet half the sponsors are at
least considering him. If I had any money, I’d bet on him myself.
And then they’re calling Katniss Everdeen, and I feel myself,
as if in a dream, standing and making my way center stage. I
127
shake Caesar’s outstretched hand, and he has the good grace
not to immediately wipe his off on his suit.
So, Katniss, the Capitol must be quite a change from District
Twelve. What’s impressed you most since you arrived
here? asks Caesar.
What? What did he say? It’s as if the words make no sense.
My mouth has gone as dry as sawdust. I desperately find
Cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him. I imagine the
words coming from his lips. What’s impressed you most since
you arrived here? I rack my brain for something that made
me happy here. Be honest, I think. Be honest.
The lamb stew, I get out.
Caesar laughs, and vaguely I realize some of the audience
has joined in.
The one with the dried plums? asks Caesar. I nod. Oh, I
eat it by the bucketful. He turns sideways to the audience in
horror, hand on his stomach. It doesn’t show, does it? They
shout reassurances to him and applaud. This is what I mean
about Caesar. He tries to help you out.
Now, Katniss, he says confidentially, When you came out
in the opening ceremonies, my heart actually stopped. What
did you think of that costume?
Cinna raises one eyebrow at me. Be honest. You mean after
I got over my fear of being burned alive? I ask.
Big laugh. A real one from the audience.
Yes. Start then, says Caesar.
Cinna, my friend, I should tell him anyway. I thought Cinna
was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous costume I’d ever
128
seen and I couldn’t believe I was wearing it. I can’t believe I’m
wearing this, either. I lift up my skirt to spread it out. I mean,
look at it!
As the audience oohs and ahs, I see Cinna make the tiniest
circular motion with his finger. But I know what he’s saying.
Twirl for me.
I spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate.
Oh, do that again! says Caesar, and so I lift up my arms
and spin around and around letting the skirt fly out, letting
the dress engulf me in flames. The audience breaks into
cheers. When I stop, I clutch Caesar’s arm.
Don’t stop! he says.
I have to, I’m dizzy! I’m also giggling, which I think I’ve
done maybe never in my lifetime. But the nerves and the
spinning have gotten to me.
Caesar wraps a protective arm around me. Don’t worry,
I’ve got you. Can’t have you following in your mentor’s footsteps.
Everyone’s hooting as the cameras find Haymitch, who is
by now famous for his head dive at the reaping, and he waves
them away good-naturedly and points back to me.
It’s all right, Caesar reassures the crowd. She’s safe with
me. So, how about that training score. E-le-ven. Give us a hint
what happened in there.
I glance at the Gamemakers on the balcony and bite my lip.
Um . . . all I can say, is I think it was a first.
The cameras are right on the Gamemakers, who are chuckling
and nodding.
129
You’re killing us, says Caesar as if in actual pain. Details.
Details.
I address the balcony. I’m not supposed to talk about it,
right?
The Gamemaker who fell in the punch bowl shouts out,
She’s not!
Thank you, I say. Sorry. My lips are sealed.
Let’s go back then, to the moment they called your sister’s
name at the reaping, says Caesar. His mood is quieter now.
And you volunteered. Can you tell us about her?
No. No, not all of you. But maybe Cinna. I don’t think I’m
imagining the sadness on his face. Her name’s Prim. She’s just
twelve. And I love her more than anything.
You could hear a pin drop in the City Circle now.
What did she say to you? After the reaping? Caesar asks.
Be honest. Be honest. I swallow hard. She asked me to try
really hard to win. The audience is frozen, hanging on my
every word.
And what did you say? prompts Caesar gently.
But instead of warmth, I feel an icy rigidity take over my
body. My muscles tense as they do before a kill. When I speak,
my voice seems to have dropped an octave. I swore I would.
I bet you did, says Caesar, giving me a squeeze. The buzzer
goes off. Sorry we’re out of time. Best of luck, Katniss
Everdeen, tribute from District Twelve.
The applause continues long after I’m seated. I look to Cinna
for reassurance. He gives me a subtle thumbs-up.
130
I’m still in a daze for the first part of Peeta’s interview. He
has the audience from the get-go, though; I can hear them
laughing, shouting out. He plays up the baker’s son thing,
comparing the tributes to the breads from their districts. Then
has a funny anecdote about the perils of the Capitol showers.
Tell me, do I still smell like roses? he asks Caesar, and then
there’s a whole run where they take turns sniffing each other
that brings down the house. I’m coming back into focus when
Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home.
Peeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of his
head.
Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl.
Come on, what’s her name? says Caesar.
Peeta sighs. Well, there is this one girl. I’ve had a crush on
her ever since I can remember. But I’m pretty sure she didn’t
know I was alive until the reaping.
Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they
can relate to.
She have another fellow? asks Caesar.
I don’t know, but a lot of boys like her, says Peeta.
So, here’s what you do. You win, you go home. She can’t
turn you down then, eh? says Caesar encouragingly.
I don’t think it’s going to work out. Winning . . . won’t help
in my case, says Peeta.
Why ever not? says Caesar, mystified.
Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out. Because . . . because
. . . she came here with me.
131
PART II
"THE GAMES"
132
For a moment, the cameras hold on Peeta’s downcast eyes
as what he says sinks in. Then I can see my face, mouth half
open in a mix of surprise and protest, magnified on every
screen as I realize, Me! He means me! I press my lips together
and stare at the floor, hoping this will conceal the emotions
starting to boil up inside of me.
Oh, that is a piece of bad luck, says Caesar, and there’s a
real edge of pain in his voice. The crowd is murmuring in
agreement, a few have even given agonized cries.
It’s not good, agrees Peeta.
Well, I don’t think any of us can blame you. It’d be hard not
to fall for that young lady, says Caesar. She didn’t know?
Peeta shakes his head. Not until now.
I allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long enough to
see that the blush on my cheeks is unmistakable.
Wouldn’t you love to pull her back out here and get a response?
Caesar asks the audience. The crowd screams assent.
Sadly, rules are rules, and Katniss Everdeen’s time has been
spent. Well, best of luck to you, Peeta Mellark, and I think I
speak for all of Panem when I say our hearts go with yours.
The roar of the crowd is deafening. Peeta has absolutely
wiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love
133
for me. When the audience finally settles down, he chokes out
a quiet Thank you and returns to his seat. We stand for the
anthem. I have to raise my head out of the required respect
and cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now dominated
by a shot of Peeta and me, separated by a few feet that in the
viewers’ heads can never be breached. Poor tragic us.
But I know better.
After the anthem, the tributes file back into the Training
Center lobby and onto the elevators. I make sure to veer into a
car that does not contain Peeta. The crowd slows our entourages
of stylists and mentors and chaperones, so we have only
each other for company. No one speaks. My elevator stops to
deposit four tributes before I am alone and then find the doors
opening on the twelfth floor. Peeta has only just stepped from
his car when I slam my palms into his chest. He loses his balance
and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers. The
urn tips and shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces. Peeta lands
in the shards, and blood immediately flows from his hands.
What was that for? he says, aghast.
You had no right! No right to go saying those things about
me! I shout at him.
Now the elevators open and the whole crew is there, Effie,
Haymitch, Cinna, and Portia.
What’s going on? says Effie, a note of hysteria in her
voice. Did you fall?
After she shoved me, says Peeta as Effie and Cinna help
him up.
Haymitch turns on me. Shoved him?
134
This was your idea, wasn’t it? Turning me into some kind
of fool in front of the entire country? I answer.
It was my idea, says Peeta, wincing as he pulls spikes of
pottery from his palms. Haymitch just helped me with it.
Yes, Haymitch is very helpful. To you! I say.
You are a fool, Haymitch says in disgust. Do you think he
hurt you? That boy just gave you something you could never
achieve on your own.
He made me look weak! I say.
He made you look desirable! And let’s face it, you can use
all the help you can get in that department. You were about as
romantic as dirt until he said he wanted you. Now they all do.
You’re all they’re talking about. The star-crossed lovers from
District Twelve! says Haymitch.
But we’re not star-crossed lovers! I say.
Haymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against the wall.
Who cares? It’s all a big show. It’s all how you’re perceived.
The most I could say about you after your interview was that
you were nice enough, although that in itself was a small miracle.
Now I can say you’re a heartbreaker. Oh, oh, oh, how the
boys back home fall longingly at your feet. Which do you think
will get you more sponsors?
The smell of wine on his breath makes me sick. I shove his
hands off my shoulders and step away, trying to clear my
head.
Cinna comes over and puts his arm around me. He’s right,
Katniss.
135
I don’t know what to think. I should have been told, so I
didn’t look so stupid.
No, your reaction was perfect. If you’d known, it wouldn’t
have read as real, says Portia.
She’s just worried about her boyfriend, says Peeta gruffly,
tossing away a bloody piece of the urn.
My cheeks burn again at the thought of Gale. I don’t have a
boyfriend.
Whatever, says Peeta. But I bet he’s smart enough to
know a bluff when he sees it. Besides you didn’t say you loved
me. So what does it matter?
The words are sinking in. My anger fading. I’m torn now between
thinking I’ve been used and thinking I’ve been given an
edge. Haymitch is right. I survived my interview, but what was
I really? A silly girl spinning in a sparkling, dress. Giggling. The
only moment of any substance I hail was when I talked about
Prim. Compare that with Thresh, his silent, deadly power, and
I’m forgettable. Silly and sparkly and forgettable. No, not entirely
forgettable, I have my eleven in training.
But now Peeta has made me an object of love. Not just his.
To hear him tell it I have many admirers. And if the audience
really thinks we’re in love . . . I remember how strongly they
responded to his confession. Star-crossed lovers. Haymitch is
right, they eat that stuff up in the Capitol. Suddenly I’m worried
that I didn’t react properly.
After he said he loved me, did you think I could be in love
with him, too? I ask.
136
I did, says Portia. The way you avoided looking at the
cameras, the blush.
They others chime in, agreeing.
You’re golden, sweetheart. You’re going to have sponsors
lined up around the block, says Haymitch.
I’m embarrassed about my reaction. I force myself to acknowledge
Peeta. I’m sorry I shoved you.
Doesn’t matter, he shrugs. Although it’s technically illegal.
Are your hands okay? I ask. They’ll be all right, he says.
In the silence that follows, delicious smells of our dinner
waft in from the dining room. Come on, let’s eat, says Haymitch.
We all follow him to the table and take our places. But
then Peeta is bleeding too heavily, and Portia leads him off for
medical treatment. We start the cream and rose-petal soup
without them. By the time we’ve finished, they’re back. Peeta’s
hands are wrapped in bandages. I can’t help feeling guilty.
Tomorrow we will be in the arena. He has done me a favor
and I have answered with an injury. Will I never stop owing
him?
After dinner, we watch the replay in the sitting room. I
seem frilly and shallow, twirling and giggling in my dress, although
the others assure me I am charming. Peeta actually is
charming and then utterly winning as the boy in love. And
there I am, blushing and confused, made beautiful by Cinna’s
hands, desirable by Peeta’s confession, tragic by circumstance,
and by all accounts, unforgettable.
137
When the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark, a hush
falls on the room. Tomorrow at dawn, we will be roused and
prepared for the arena. The actual Games don’t start until ten
because so many of the Capitol residents rise late. But Peeta
and I must make an early start. There is no telling how far we
will travel to the arena that has been prepared for this year’s
Games.
I know Haymitch and Effie will not be going with us. As
soon as they leave here, they’ll be at the Games Headquarters,
hopefully madly signing up our sponsors, working out a strategy
on how and when to deliver the gifts to us. Cinna and Portia
will travel with us to the very spot from which we will be
launched into the arena. Still final good-byes must be said
here.
Effie takes both of us by the hand and, with actual tears in
her eyes, wishes us well. Thanks us for being the best tributes
it has ever been her privilege to sponsor. And then, because
it’s Effie and she’s apparently required by law to say something
awful, she adds I wouldn’t be at all surprised if I finally
get promoted to a decent district next year!
Then she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries out, overcome
with either the emotional parting or the possible improvement
of her fortunes.
Haymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over.
Any final words of advice? asks Peeta.
When the gong sounds, get the hell out of there. You’re
neither of you up to the blood bath at the Cornucopia. Just
138
clear out, put as much distance as you can between yourselves
and the others, and find a source of water, he says. Got it?
And after that? I ask.
Stay alive, says Haymitch. It’s the same advice he gave us
on the train, but he’s not drunk and laughing this time. And we
only nod. What else is there to say?
When I head to my room, Peeta lingers to talk to Portia. I’m
glad. Whatever strange words of parting we exchange can
wait until tomorrow. My covers are drawn back, but there is
no sign of the redheaded Avox girl. I wish I knew her name. I
should have asked it. She could write it down maybe. Or act it
out. But perhaps that would only result in punishment for her.
I take a shower and scrub the gold paint, the makeup, the
scent of beauty from my body. All that remains of the designteam’s
efforts are the flames on my nails. I decide to keep
them as reminder of who I am to the audience. Katniss, the
girl who was on fire. Perhaps it will give me something to hold
on to in the days to come.
I pull on a thick, fleecy nightgown and climb into bed. It
takes me about five seconds to realize I’ll never fall asleep.
And I need sleep desperately because in the arena every moment
I give in to fatigue will be an invitation to death.
It’s no good. One hour, two, three pass, and my eyelids
refuse to get heavy. I can’t stop trying to imagine exactly what
terrain I’ll be thrown into. Desert? Swamp? A frigid wasteland?
Above all I am hoping for trees, which may afford me
some means of concealment and food and shelter, Often there
are trees because barren landscapes are dull and the Games
139
resolve too quickly without them. But what will the climate be
like? What traps have the Gamemakers hid den to liven up the
slower moments? And then there are my fellow tributes . . .
The more anxious I am to find sleep, the more it eludes me.
Finally, I am too restless to even stay in bed. I pace the floor,
heart beating too fast, breathing too short. My room feels like
a prison cell. If I don’t get air soon, I’m going to start to throw
things again. I run down the hall to the door to the roof. It’s
not only unlocked but ajar. Perhaps someone forgot to close it,
but it doesn’t matter. The energy field enclosing the roof prevents
any desperate form of escape. And I’m not looking to escape,
only to fill my lungs with air. I want to see the sky and
the moon on the last night that no one will be hunting me.
The roof is not lit at night, but as soon as my bare feel reach
its tiled surface I see his silhouette, black against the lights
that shine endlessly in the Capitol. There’s quite a commotion
going on down in the streets, music and singing and car horns,
none of which I could hear through the thick glass window
panels in my room. I could slip away now, without him noticing
me; he wouldn’t hear me over the din, But the night air’s
so sweet, I can’t bear returning to that stuffy cage of a room.
And what difference does it make? Whether we speak or not?
My feet move soundlessly across the tiles. I’m only yard behind
him when I say, You should be getting some sleep.
He starts but doesn’t turn. I can see him give his head a
slight shake. I didn’t want to miss the party. It’s for us, after
all.
140
I come up beside him and lean over the edge of the rail. The
wide streets are full of dancing people. I squint to make out
their tiny figures in more detail. Are they in costumes?
Who could tell? Peeta answers. With all the crazy clothes
they wear here. Couldn’t sleep, either?
Couldn’t turn my mind off, I say.
Thinking about your family? he asks.
No, I admit a bit guiltily. All I can do is wonder about tomorrow.
Which is pointless, of course. In the light from below,
I can see his face now, the awkward way he holds his
bandaged hands. I really am sorry about your hands.
It doesn’t matter, Katniss, he says. I’ve never been a contender
in these Games anyway.
That’s no way to be thinking, I say.
Why not? It’s true. My best hope is to not disgrace myself
and . . . He hesitates.
And what? I say.
I don’t know how to say it exactly. Only . . . I want to die as
myself. Does that make any sense? he asks. I shake my head.
How could he die as anyone but himself? I don’t want them to
change me in there. Turn me into some kind of monster that
I’m not.
I bite my lip feeling inferior. While I’ve been ruminating on
the availability of trees, Peeta has been struggling with how to
maintain his identity. His purity of self. Do you mean you
won’t kill anyone? I ask.
No, when the time comes, I’m sure I’ll kill just like everybody
else. I can’t go down without a fight. Only I keep wishing
141
I could think of a way to . . . to show the Capitol they don’t own
me. That I’m more than just a piece in their Games, says Peeta.
But you’re not, I say. None of us are. That’s how the
Games work.
Okay, but within that framework, there’s still you, there’s
still me, he insists. Don’t you see?
A little. Only . . . no offense, but who cares, Peeta? I say.
I do. I mean, what else am I allowed to care about at this
point? he asks angrily. He’s locked those blue eyes on mine
now, demanding an answer.
I take a step back. Care about what Haymitch said. About
staying alive.
Peeta smiles at me, sad and mocking. Okay. Thanks for the
tip, sweetheart.
It’s like a slap in the face. His use of Haymitch’s patronizing
endearment. Look, if you want to spend the last hours of your
life planning some noble death in the arena, that’s your choice.
I want to spend mine in District Twelve.
Wouldn’t surprise me if you do, says Peeta. Give my
mother my best when you make it back, will you?
Count on it, I say. Then I turn and leave the roof. I spend
the rest of the night slipping in and out of a doze, imagining
the cutting remarks I will make to Peeta Mellark in the morning.
Peeta Mellark. We will see how high and mighty he is
when he's faced with life and death. He'll probably turn into
one of those raging beast tributes, the kind who tries to eat
someone's heart after they've killed them. There was a guy
142
like that a few years ago from District 6 called Titus. He went
completely savage and the Gamemakers had to have him
stunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players
he'd killed before he ate them. There are no rules in the arena,
but cannibalism doesn't play well with the Capitol audience,
so they tried to head it off. There was some speculation that
the avalanche that finally took Titus out was specifically engineered
to ensure the victor was not a lunatic.
I don't see Peeta in the morning. Cinna comes to me before
dawn, gives me a simple shift to wear, and guides me to the
roof. My final dressing and preparations will be alone in the
catacombs under the arena itself. A hovercraft appears out of
thin air, just like the one did in the woods the day I saw the
redheaded Avox girl captured, and a ladder drops down. I
place my hands and feet on the lower rungs and instantly it's
as if I'm frozen. Some sort of current glues me to the ladder
while I'm lifted safely inside.
I expect the ladder to release me then, but I'm still stuck
when a woman in a white coat approaches me carrying a syringe.
"This is just your tracker, Katniss. The stiller you are,
the more efficiently I can place it," she says.
Still? I'm a statue. But that doesn't prevent me from feeling
the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts the metal tracking
device deep under the skin on the inside of my forearm. Now
the Gamemakers will always be able to trace my whereabouts
in the arena. Wouldn’t want to lose a tribute.
As soon as the tracker’s in place, the ladder releases me.
The woman disappears and Cinna is retrieved from the roof,
143
An Avox boy comes in and directs us to a room where breakfast
has been laid out. Despite the tension in my stomach, I eat
as much as I can, although none of the delectable food makes
any impression on me. I’m so nervous, I could be eating coal
dust. The one thing that distracts me at all is the view from the
windows as we sail over the city and then to the wilderness
beyond. This is what birds see. Only they’re free and safe. The
very opposite of me.
The ride lasts about half an hour before the windows black
out, suggesting that we’re nearing the arena. The hovercraft
lands and Cinna and I go back to the ladder, only this time it
leads down into a tube underground, into the catacombs that
lie beneath the arena. We follow instructions to my destination,
a chamber for my preparation. In the Capitol, they call it
the Launch Room. In the districts, it’s referred to as the Stockyard.
The place animals go before slaughter.
Everything is brand-new, I will be the first and only tribute
to use this Launch Room. The arenas are historic sites, preserved
after the Games. Popular destinations for Capitol residents
to visit, to vacation. Go for a month, rewatch the Games,
tour the catacombs, visit the sites where the deaths took
place. You can even take part in reenactments. They say the
food is excellent.
I struggle to keep my breakfast down as I shower and clean
my teeth. Cinna does my hair in my simple trademark braid
down my back. Then the clothes arrive, the same for every
tribute. Cinna has had no say in my outfit, does not even know
what will be in the package, but he helps me dress in the un-
144
dergarments, simple tawny pants, light green blouse, sturdy
brown belt, and thin, hooded black jacket that falls to my
thighs. The material in the jacket’s designed to reflect body
heat. Expect some cool nights, he says.
The boots, worn over skintight socks, are better than I
could have hoped for. Soft leather not unlike my ones at home.
These have a narrow flexible rubber sole with treads though.
Good for running.
I think I’m finished when Cinna pulls the gold mockingjay
pin from his pocket. I had completely forgotten about it.
Where did you get that? I ask.
Off the green outfit you wore on the train, he says. I remember
now taking it off my mother’s dress, pinning it to the
shirt. It’s your district token, right? I nod and he fastens it on
my shirt. It barely cleared the review board. Some thought
the pin could be used as a weapon, giving you an unfair advantage.
But eventually, they let it through, says Cinna. They
eliminated a ring from that District One girl, though. If you
twisted the gemstone, a spike popped out. Poisoned one. She
claimed she had no knowledge the ring transformed and there
was no way to prove she did. But she lost her token. There,
you’re all set. Move around. Make sure everything feels comfortable.
I walk, run in a circle, swing my arms about. Yes, it’s fine.
Fits perfectly.
Then there’s nothing to do but wait for the call, says Cinna.
Unless you think you could eat any more?
145
I turn down food but accept a glass of water that I take tiny
sips of as we wait on a couch. I don’t want to chew on my nails
or lips, so I find myself gnawing on the inside of my cheek. It
still hasn’t fully healed from a few days ago. Soon the taste of
blood fills my mouth.
Nervousness seeps into terror as I anticipate what is to
come. I could be dead, flat-out dead, in an hour. Not even. My
fingers obsessively trace the hard little lump on my forearm
where the woman injected the tracking device. I press on it,
even though it hurts, I press on it so hard a small bruise begins
to form.
Do you want to talk, Katniss? Cinna asks.
I shake my head but after a moment hold out my hand to
him. Cinna encloses it in both of his. And this is how we sit until
a pleasant female voice announces it’s time to prepare for
launch.
Still clenching one of Cinna’s hands, I walk over and stand
on the circular metal plate. Remember what Haymitch said.
Run, find water. The rest will follow, he says. I nod. And remember
this. I’m not allowed to bet, but if I could, my money
would be on you.
Truly? I whisper.
Truly, says Cinna. He leans down and kisses me on the
forehead. Good luck, girl on fire. And then a glass cylinder is
lowering around me, breaking our handhold, cutting him off
from me. He taps his fingers under his chin. Head high.
I lift my chin and stand as straight as I can. The cylinder begins
to rise. For maybe fifteen seconds, I’m in darkness and
146
then I can feel the metal plate pushing me out of the cylinder,
into the open air. For a moment, my eyes are dazzled by the
bright sunlight and I’m conscious only of a strong wind with
the hopeful smell of pine trees.
Then I hear the legendary announcer, Claudius Templesmith,
as his voice booms all around me.
Ladies and gentlemen, let the Seventy-fourth Hunger
Games begin!
147
Sixty seconds. That’s how long we’re required to stand on
our metal circles before the sound of a gong releases us. Step
off before the minute is up, and land mines blow your legs off.
Sixty seconds to take in the ring of tributes all equidistant
from the Cornucopia, a giant golden horn shaped like a cone
with a curved tail, the mouth of which is at least twenty feet
high, spilling over with the things that will give us life here in
the arena. Food, containers of water, weapons, medicine, garments,
fire starters. Strewn around the Cornucopia are other
supplies, their value decreasing the farther they are from the
horn. For instance, only a few steps from my feet lays a threefoot
square of plastic. Certainly it could be of some use in a
downpour. But there in the mouth, I can see a tent pack that
would protect from almost any sort of weather. If I had the
guts to go in and fight for it against the other twenty-three tributes.
Which I have been instructed not to do.
We’re on a flat, open stretch of ground. A plain of hardpacked
dirt. Behind the tributes across from me, I can see
nothing, indicating either a steep downward slope or even
cliff. To my right lies a lake. To my left and back, spars piney
woods. This is where Haymitch would want me to go. Immediately.
148
I hear his instructions in my head. Just clear out, put as
much distance as you can between yourselves and the others,
and find a source of water.
But it’s tempting, so tempting, when I see the bounty waiting
there before me. And I know that if I don’t get it, someone
else will. That the Career Tributes who survive the bloodbath
will divide up most of these life-sustaining spoils. Something
catches my eye. There, resting on a mound of blanket rolls, is a
silver sheath of arrows and a bow, already strung, just waiting
to be engaged. That’s mine, I think. It’s meant for me.
I’m fast. I can sprint faster than any of the girls in our
school although a couple can beat me in distance races. But
this forty-yard length, this is what I am built for. I know I can
get it, I know I can reach it first, but then the question is how
quickly can I get out of there? By the time I’ve scrambled up
the packs and grabbed the weapons, others will have reached
the horn, and one or two I might be able to pick off, but say
there’s a dozen, at that close range, they could take me down
with the spears and the clubs. Or their own powerful fists.
Still, I won’t be the only target. I’m betting many of the other
tributes would pass up a smaller girl, even one who scored
an eleven in training, to take out their more fierce adversaries.
Haymitch has never seen me run. Maybe if he had he’d tell
me to go for it. Get the weapon. Since that’s the very weapon
that might be my salvation. And I only see one bow in that
whole pile. I know the minute must be almost up and will have
to decide what my strategy will be and I find myself positioning
my feet to run, not away into the stir rounding forests but
149
toward the pile, toward the bow. When suddenly I notice Peeta,
he’s about five tributes to my right, quite a fair distance,
still I can tell he’s looking at me and I think he might be shaking
his head. But the sun’s in my eyes, and while I’m puzzling
over it the gong rings out.
And I’ve missed it! I’ve missed my chance! Because those
extra couple of seconds I’ve lost by not being ready are
enough to change my mind about going in. My feet shuffle for
a moment, confused at the direction my brain wants to take
and then I lunge forward, scoop up the sheet of plastic and a
loaf of bread. The pickings are so small and I’m so angry with
Peeta for distracting me that I sprint in twenty yards to retrieve
a bright orange backpack that could hold anything because
I can’t stand leaving with virtually nothing.
A boy, I think from District 9, reaches the pack at the same
time I do and for a brief time we grapple for it and then he
coughs, splattering my face with blood. I stagger back, repulsed
by the warm, sticky spray. Then the boy slips to the
ground. That’s when I see the knife in his back. Already other
tributes have reached the Cornucopia and are spreading out
to attack. Yes, the girl from District 2, ten yards away, running
toward me, one hand clutching a half-dozen knives. I’ve seen
her throw in training. She never misses. And I’m her next target.
All the general fear I’ve been feeling condenses into at immediate
fear of this girl, this predator who might kill me in
seconds. Adrenaline shoots through me and I sling the pack
over one shoulder and run full-speed for the woods. I can hear
150
the blade whistling toward me and reflexively hike the pack
up to protect my head. The blade lodges in the pack. Both
straps on my shoulders now, I make for the trees. Somehow I
know the girl will not pursue me. That she’ll be drawn back into
the Cornucopia before all the good stuff is gone. A grin
crosses my face. Thanks for the knife, I think.
At the edge of the woods I turn for one instant to survey the
field. About a dozen or so tributes are hacking away at one
another at the horn. Several lie dead already on the ground.
Those who have taken flight are disappearing into the trees or
into the void opposite me. I continue running until the woods
have hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a
steady jog that I think I can maintain for a while. For the next
few hours, I alternate between jogging and walking, putting as
much distance as I can between myself and my competitors. I
lost my bread during the struggle with the boy from District 9
but managed to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as I walk I fold
it neatly and tuck it into a pocket. I also free the knife — it’s a
fine one with a long sharp blade, serrated near the handle,
which will make it handy for sawing through things — and
slide it into my belt. I don’t dare stop to examine the contents
of the pack yet. I just keep moving, pausing only to check for
pursuers.
I can go a long time. I know that from my days in the
woods. But I will need water. That was Haymitch’s second instruction,
and since I sort of botched the first, I keep a sharp
eye out for any sign of it. No luck.
151
The woods begin to evolve, and the pines are intermixed
with a variety of trees, some I recognize, some completely foreign
to me. At one point, I hear a noise and pull my knife,
thinking I may have to defend myself, but I’ve only startled a
rabbit. Good to see you, I whisper. If there’s one rabbit, there
could be hundreds just waiting to be snared.
The ground slopes down. I don’t particularly like this. Valleys
make me feel trapped. I want to be high, like in the hills
around District 12, where I can see my enemies approaching.
But I have no choice but to keep going.
Funny though, I don’t feel too bad. The days of gorging myself
have paid off. I’ve got staying power even though I’m
short on sleep. Being in the woods is rejuvenating. I’m glad for
the solitude, even though it’s an illusion, because I’m probably
on-screen right now. Not consistently but off and on. There
are so many deaths to show the first day that a tribute trekking
through the woods isn’t much to look at. But they’ll show
me enough to let people know I’m alive, uninjured and on the
move. One of the heaviest days of betting is the opening, when
the initial casualties come in. But that can’t compare to what
happens as the field shrinks to a handful of players.
It’s late afternoon when I begin to hear the cannons. Each
shot represents a dead tribute. The fighting must have finally
stopped at the Cornucopia. They never collect the bloodbath
bodies until the killers have dispersed. On the opening day,
they don’t even fire the cannons until the initial fighting’s over
because it’s too hard to keep track of the fatalities. I allow myself
to pause, panting, as I count the shots. One . . . two . . .
152
three . . . on and on until they reach eleven. Eleven dead in all.
Thirteen left to play. My fingernails scrape at the dried blood
the boy from District 9 coughed into my face. He’s gone, certainly.
I wonder about Peeta. Has he lasted through the day?
I’ll know in a few hours. When they project the dead’s images
into the sky for the rest of us to see.
All of a sudden, I’m overwhelmed by the thought that Peeta
may be already lost, bled white, collected, and in the process
of being transported back to the Capitol to be cleaned up, redressed,
and shipped in a simple wooden box back to District
12. No longer here. Heading home. I try hard to remember if I
saw him once the action started. But the last image I can conjure
up is Peeta shaking his head as the gong rang out.
Maybe it’s better, if he’s gone already. He had no confidence
he could win. And I will not end up with the unpleasant task of
killing him. Maybe it’s better if he’s out of this for good.
I slump down next to my pack, exhausted. I need to go
through it anyway before night falls. See what I have to work
with. As I unhook the straps, I can feel it’s sturdily made although
a rather unfortunate color. This orange will practically
glow in the dark. I make a mental note to camouflage it first
thing tomorrow.
I flip open the flap. What I want most, right at this moment,
is water. Haymitch’s directive to immediately find water was
not arbitrary. I won’t last long without it. For a few days, I’ll be
able to function with unpleasant symptoms of dehydration,
but after that I'll deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in
a week, tops. I carefully lay out the provisions. One thin black
153
sleeping bag that reflects body heal. A pack of crackers. A pack
of dried beef strips. A bottle of iodine. A box of wooden
matches. A small coil of wire. A pair of sunglasses. And a halfgallon
plastic bottle with a cap for carrying water that's bone
dry.
No water. How hard would it have been for them to fill up
the bottle? I become aware of the dryness in my throat and
mouth, the cracks in my lips. I've been moving all day long. It's
been hot and I've sweat a lot. I do this at home, but there are
always streams to drink from, or snow to melt if it should
come to it.
As I refill my pack I have an awful thought. The lake. The one
I saw while I was waiting for the gong to sound. What if that's
the only water source in the arena? That way they'll guarantee
drawing us in to fight. The lake is a full day's journey from
where I sit now, a much harder journey with nothing to drink.
And then, even if I reach it, it's sure to be heavily guarded by
some of the Career Tributes. I'm about to panic when I remember
the rabbit I startled earlier today. It has to drink, too.
I just have to find out where.
Twilight is closing in and I am ill at ease. The trees are too
thin to offer much concealment. The layer of pine needles that
muffles my footsteps also makes tracking animals harder
when I need their trails to find water. And I'm still heading
downhill, deeper and deeper into a valley that seems endless.
I’m hungry, too, but I don’t dare break into my precious
store of crackers and beef yet. Instead, I take my knife and go
to work on a pine tree, cutting away the outer bark and scrap-
154
ing off a large handful of the softer inner bark. I slowly chew
the stuff as I walk along. After a week of the finest food in the
world, it’s a little hard to choke down. But I’ve eaten plenty of
pine in my life. I’ll adjust quickly.
In another hour, it’s clear I’ve got to find a place to camp.
Night creatures are coming out. I can hear the occasional hoot
or howl, my first clue that I’ll be competing with natural predators
for the rabbits. As to whether I’ll be viewed as a source
of food, it’s too soon to tell. There could be any number of animals
stalking me at this moment.
But right now, I decide to make my fellow tributes a priority.
I’m sure many will continue hunting through the night.
Those who fought it out at the Cornucopia will have food, an
abundance of water from the lake, torches or flashlights, and
weapons they’re itching to use. I can only hope I’ve traveled
far and fast enough to be out of range.
Before settling down, I take my wire and set two twitch-up
snares in the brush. I know it’s risky to be setting traps, but
food will go so fast out here. And I can’t set snares on the run.
Still, I walk another five minutes before making camp.
I pick my tree carefully. A willow, not terribly tall but set in
a clump of other willows, offering concealment in those long,
flowing tresses. I climb up, sticking to the stronger branches
close to the trunk, and find a sturdy fork for my bed. It takes
some doing, but I arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable
manner. I place my backpack in the foot of the bag,
then slide in after it. As a precaution, I remove my belt, loop it
all the way around the branch and my sleeping bag, and refas-
155
ten it at my waist. Now if I roll over in my sleep, I won’t go
crashing to the ground. I’m small enough to tuck the top of the
bag over my head, but I put on my hood as well. As night falls,
the air is cooling quickly. Despite the risk I took in getting the
backpack, I know now it was the right choice. This sleeping
bag, radiating back and preserving my body heat, will be invaluable.
I’m sure there are several other tributes whose biggest
concern right now is how to stay warm whereas I may actually
be able to get a few hours of sleep. If only I wasn’t so thirsty
. . .
Night has just come when I hear the anthem that proceeds
the death recap. Through the branches I can see the seal of the
Capitol, which appears to be floating in the sky. I’m actually
viewing another screen, an enormous one that’s transported
by of one of their disappearing hovercraft. The anthem fades
out and the sky goes dark for a moment. At home, we would
be watching full coverage of each and every killing, but that’s
thought to give an unfair advantage to the living tributes. For
instance, if I got my hands on the bow and shot someone, my
secret would be revealed to all. No, here in the arena, all we
see are the same photographs they showed when they televised
our training scores. Simple head shots. But now instead
of scores they post only district numbers. I take a deep breath
as the face of the eleven dead tributes begin and tick them off
one by one on my fingers.
The first to appear is the girl from District 3. That means
that the Career Tributes from 1 and 2 have all survived. No
surprise there. Then the boy from 4. I didn’t expect that one,
156
usually all the Careers make it through the first day. The boy
from District 5 . . . I guess the fox-faced girl made it. Both tributes
from 6 and 7. The boy from 8. Both from 9. Yes, there’s
the boy who I fought for the backpack. I’ve run through my
fingers, only one more dead tribute to go. Is it Peeta? No,
there’s the girl from District 10. That’s it. The Capitol seal is
back with a final musical flourish. Then darkness and the
sounds of the forest resume.
I’m relieved Peeta’s alive. I tell myself again that if I get
killed, his winning will benefit my mother and Prim the most.
This is what I tell myself to explain the conflicting emotions
that arise when I think of Peeta. The gratitude that he gave me
an edge by professing his love for me in the interview. The anger
at his superiority on the roof. The dread that we may come
face-to-face at any moment in this arena.
Eleven dead, but none from District 12. I try to work out
who is left. Five Career Tributes. Foxface. Thresh and Rue. Rue
. . . so she made it through the first day after all. I can’t help
feeling glad. That makes ten of us. The other three I’ll figure
out tomorrow. Now when it is dark, and I have traveled far,
and I am nestled high in this tree, now I must try and rest.
I haven’t really slept in two days, and then there’s been the
long day’s journey into the arena. Slowly, I allow my muscles
to relax. My eyes to close. The last thing I think is it’s lucky I
don’t snore. . . .
Snap! The sound of a breaking branch wakes me. How long
have I been asleep? Four hours? Five? The tip of my nose is icy
cold. Snap! Snap! What’s going on? This is not the sound of a
157
branch under someone’s foot, but the sharp crack of one coming
from a tree. Snap! Snap! I judge it to be several hundred
yards to my right. Slowly, noiselessly, I turn myself in that direction.
For a few minutes, there’s nothing but blackness and
some scuffling. Then I see a spark and a small fire begins to
bloom. A pair of hands warms over flames, but I can’t make
out more than that.
I have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name I know
at the fire starter. What are they thinking? A fire I’ll just at
nightfall would have been one thing. Those who battled at the
Cornucopia, with their superior strength and surplus of supplies,
they couldn’t possibly have been near enough to spot
the flames then. But now, when they’ve probably been combing
the woods for hours looking for victims. You might as
well be waving a flag and shouting, Come and get me!
And here I am a stone’s throw from the biggest idiot in
the Games. Strapped in a tree. Not daring to flee since my
general location has just been broadcast to any killer who
cares. I mean, I know it’s cold out here and not everybody
has a sleeping bag. But then you grit your teeth and stick it
out until dawn!
I lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of hours really
thinking that if I can get out of this tree, I won’t have the
least problem taking out my new neighbor. My instinct has
been to flee, not fight. But obviously this person’s a hazard.
Stupid people are dangerous. And this one probably doesn’t
have much in the way of weapons while I’ve got this excellent
knife.
158
The sky is still dark, but I can feel the first signs of dawn
approaching. I’m beginning to think we — meaning the person
whose death I’m now devising and me — we might actually
have gone unnoticed. Then I hear it. Several pairs of feet
breaking into a run. The fire starter must have dozed off.
They’re on her before she can escape. I know it’s a girl now, I
can tell by the pleading, the agonized scream that follows.
Then there’s laughter and congratulations from several voices.
Someone cries out, Twelve down and eleven to go! which
gets a round of appreciative hoots.
So they’re fighting in a pack. I’m not really surprised. Often
alliances are formed in the early stages of the Games. The
strong band together to hunt down the weak then, when the
tension becomes too great, begin to turn on one another. I
don’t have to wonder too hard who has made this alliance. It’ll
be the remaining Career Tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4.
Two boys and three girls. The ones who lunched together.
For a moment, I hear them checking the girl for supplies. I
can tell by their comments they’ve found nothing good. I wonder
if the victim is Rue but quickly dismiss the thought. She’s
much too bright to be building a fire like that.
Better clear out so they can get the body before it starts
stinking. I’m almost certain that’s the brutish boy from District
2. There are murmurs of assent and then, to my horror, I
hear the pack heading toward me. They do not know I’m here.
How could they? And I’m well concealed in the clump of trees.
At least while the sun stays down. Then my black sleeping bag
159
will turn from camouflage to trouble. If they just keep moving,
they will pass me and be gone in a minute.
But the Careers stop in the clearing about ten yards from
my tree. They have flashlights, torches. I can see an arm here,
a boot there, through the breaks in the branches. I turn to
stone, not even daring to breathe. Have they spotted me? No,
not yet. I can tell from their words their minds are elsewhere.
Shouldn’t we have heard a cannon by now?
I’d say yes. Nothing to prevent them from going in immediately.
Unless she isn’t dead.
She’s dead. I stuck her myself.
Then where’s the cannon?
Someone should go back. Make sure the job’s done.
Yeah, we don’t want to have to track her down twice.
I said she’s dead!
An argument breaks out until one tribute silences the others.
We’re wasting time! I’ll go finish her and let’s move on!
I almost fall out of the tree. The voice belongs to Peeta.
160
Thank goodness, I had the foresight to belt myself in. I’ve
rolled sideways off the fork and I’m facing the ground, held in
place by the belt, one hand, and my feet straddling the pack
inside my sleeping bag, braced against the trunk. There must
have been some rustling when I tipped sideways, but the Careers
have been too caught up in their own argument to catch
it.
Go on, then, Lover Boy, says the boy from District 2. See
for yourself.
I just get a glimpse of Peeta, lit by a torch, heading back to
the girl by the fire. His face is swollen with bruises, there’s a
bloody bandage on one arm, and from the sound of his gait
he’s limping somewhat. I remember him shaking him his head,
telling me not to go into the fight for the supplies, when all
along, all along he’d planned to throw himself into the thick of
things. Just the opposite of what Haymitch had mid him to do.
Okay, I can stomach that. Seeing all those supplies was
tempting. But this . . . this other thing. This teaming up with
the Career wolf pack to hunt down the rest of us. No one from
District 12 would think of doing such a thing! Career tributes
are overly vicious, arrogant, better fed, but only because
they’re the Capitol’s lapdogs.
161
Universally, solidly hated by all but those from their own
districts. I can imagine the things they’re saying about him
back home now. And Peeta had the gall to talk to me about
disgrace?
Obviously, the noble boy on the rooftop was playing just
one more game with me. But this will be his last. I will eagerly
watch the night skies for signs of his death, if I don’t kill him
first myself.
The Career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear shot,
then use hushed voices.
Why don’t we just kill him now and get it over with?
Let him tag along. What’s the harm? And he’s handy with
that knife.
Is he? That’s news. What a lot of interesting things I’m
learning about my friend Peeta today.
Besides, he’s our best chance of finding her.
It takes me a moment to register that the her they’re referring
to is me.
Why? You think she bought into that sappy romance
stuff?
She might have. Seemed pretty simpleminded to me. Every
time I think about her spinning around in that dress, I want to
puke.
Wish we knew how she got that eleven.
Bet you Lover Boy knows.
The sound of Peeta returning silences them.
Was she dead? asks the boy from District 2.
162
No. But she is now, says Peeta. Just then, the cannon fires.
Ready to move on?
The Career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins to
break, and birdsong fills the air. I remain in my awkward position,
muscles trembling with exertion for a while longer, then
hoist myself back onto my branch. I need to get down, to get
going, but for a moment I lie there, digesting what I’ve heard.
Not only is Peeta with the Careers, he’s helping them find me.
The simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously because
of her eleven. Because she can use a bow and arrow. Which
Peeta knows better than anyone.
But he hasn’t told them yet. Is he saving that information
because he knows it’s all that keeps him alive? Is he still pretending
to love me for the audience? What is going on in his
head?
Suddenly, the birds fall silent. Then one gives a highpitched
warning call. A single note. Just like the one Gale and I
heard when the redheaded Avox girl was caught. High above
the dying campfire a hovercraft materializes. A set of huge
metal teeth drops down. Slowly, gently, the dead tribute girl is
lifted into the hovercraft. Then it vanishes. The birds resume
their song.
Move, I whisper to myself. I wriggle out of my sleeping
bag, roll it up, and place it in the pack. I take a deep breath.
While I’ve been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag
and the willow branches, it has probably been difficult for the
cameras to get a good shot of me. I know they must be track-
163
ing me now though. The minute I hit the ground, I’m guaranteed
a close-up.
The audience will have been beside themselves, knowing I
was in the tree, that I overheard the Careers talking, that I discovered
Peeta was with them. Until I work out exactly how I
want to play that, I’d better at least act on top of things. Not
perplexed. Certainly not confused or frightened.
No, I need to look one step ahead of the game.
So as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light, I
pause a second, giving the cameras time to lock on me. Then I
cock my head slightly to the side and give a knowing smile.
There! Let them figure out what that means!
I’m about to take off when I think of my snares. Maybe it’s
imprudent to check them with the others so close. But have to.
Too many years of hunting, I guess. And the lure of possible
meat. I’m rewarded with one fine rabbit. In no time, I’ve
cleaned and gutted the animal, leaving the head, feet, tail, skin,
and innards, under a pile of leaves. I’m wishing for a fire —
eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever, a lesson I learned
the hard way — when I think of the dead tribute. I hurry back
to her camp. Sure enough, the coals of her dying fire are still
hot. I cut up the rabbit, fashion a spit out of branches, and set
it over the coals.
I’m glad for the cameras now. I want sponsors to see I can
hunt, that I’m a good bet because I won’t be lured into traps as
easily as the others will by hunger. While the rabbit cooks, I
grind up part of a charred branch and set about camouflaging
my orange pack. The black tones it down, but I feel a layer of
164
mud would definitely help. Of course, to have mud, I’d need
water . . .
I pull on my gear, grab my spit, kick some dirt over the
coals, and take off in the opposite direction the Careers went. I
eat half the rabbit as I go, then wrap up the leftovers in my
plastic for later. The meat stops the grumbling in my stomach
but does little to quench my thirst. Water is my top priority
now.
As I hike along, I feel certain I’m still holding the screen in
the Capitol, so I’m careful to continue to hide my emotions.
But what a good time Claudius Templesmith must be having
with his guest commentators, dissecting Peeta’s behavior, my
reaction. What to make of it all? Has Peeta revealed his true
colors? How does this affect the betting odds? Will we lose
sponsors? Do we even have sponsors? Yes, I feel certain we
do, or at least did.
Certainly Peeta has thrown a wrench into our star-crossed
lover dynamic. Or has he? Maybe, since he hasn’t spoken much
about me, we can still get some mileage out of it. Maybe
people will think it’s something we plotted together if I seem
like it amuses me now.
The sun rises in the sky and even through the canopy it
seems overly bright. I coat my lips in some grease from the
rabbit and try to keep from panting, but it’s no use. It’s only
been a day and I’m dehydrating fast. I try and think of everything
I know about finding water. It runs downhill, so, in fact,
continuing down into this valley isn’t a bad thing. If I could
just locate a game trail or spot a particularly green patch of
165
vegetation, these might help me along, but nothing seems to
change. There’s just the slight gradual slope, the birds, the
sameness to the trees.
As the day wears on, I know I’m headed for trouble. What
little urine I’ve been able to pass is a dark brown, my head is
aching, and there’s a dry patch on my tongue that refuses to
moisten. The sun hurts my eyes so I dig out my sunglasses, but
when I put them on they do something funny to my vision, so I
just stuff them back in my pack.
It’s late afternoon when I think I’ve found help. I spot a
cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit, to suck the
sweet juices from the skins. But just as I’m holding them to my
lips, I get a hard look at them. What I thought were blueberries
have a slightly different shape, and when I break one open
the insides are bloodred. I don’t recognize these berries, perhaps
they are edible, but I’m guessing this is some evil trick on
the part of the Gamemakers. Even the plant instructor in the
Training Center made a point of telling us to avoid berries unless
you were 100 percent sure they weren’t toxic. Something
I already knew, but I’m so thirsty it takes her reminder to give
me the strength to fling them away.
Fatigue is beginning to settle on me, but it’s not the usual
tiredness that follows a long hike. I have to stop and rest frequently,
although I know the only cure for what ails me requires
continued searching. I try a new tactic — climbing a
tree as high as I dare in my shaky state — to look for any signs
of water. But as far as I can see in any direction, there’s the
same unrelenting stretch of forest.
166
Determined to go on until nightfall, I walk until I’m stumbling
over my own feet.
Exhausted, I haul myself up into a tree and belt myself in.
I’ve no appetite, but I suck on a rabbit bone just to give my
mouth something to do. Night falls, the anthem plays, and high
in the sky I see the picture of the girl, who was apparently
from District 8. The one Peeta went back to finish off.
My fear of the Career pack is minor compared to my burning
thirst. Besides, they were heading away from me and by
now they, too, will have to rest. With the scarcity of water,
they may even have had to return to the lake for refills.
Maybe, that is the only course for me as well.
Morning brings distress. My heads throbs with every beat
of my heart. Simple movements send stabs of pain through my
joints. I fall, rather than jump from the tree. It takes several
minutes for me to assemble my gear. Somewhere inside me, I
know this is wrong. I should be acting with more caution,
moving with more urgency. But my mind seems foggy and
forming a plan is hard. I lean back against the trunk of my
tree, one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper surface of my
tongue, as I assess my options. How can I get water?
Return to the lake. No good. I’d never make it.
Hope for rain. There’s not a cloud in the sky.
Keep looking. Yes, this is my only chance. But then, another
thought hits me, and the surge of anger that follows brings me
to me senses.
Haymitch! He could send me water! Press a button and
have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in minutes. I
167
know I must have sponsors, at least one or two who could afford
a pint of liquid for me. Yes, it’s pricey, but these people,
they’re made of money. And they’ll be betting on me as well.
Perhaps Haymitch doesn’t realize how deep my need is.
I say in a voice as loud as I dare. Water. I wait, hopefully,
for a parachute to descend from the sky. But nothing is forthcoming.
Something is wrong. Am I deluded about having sponsors?
Or has Peeta’s behavior made them all hang back? No, I don’t
believe it. There’s someone out there who wants to buy me
water only Haymitch is refusing to let it go through. As my
mentor, he gets to control the flow of gifts from the sponsors. I
know he hates me. He’s made that clear enough. But enough to
let me die? From this? He can’t do that, can he? If a mentor mistreats
his tributes, he’ll be held accountable by the viewers,
by the people back in District 12. Even Haymitch wouldn’t risk
that, would he? Say what you will about my fellow traders in
the Hob, but I don’t think they’d welcome him back there if he
let me die this way. And then where would he get his liquor?
So . . . what? Is he trying to make me suffer for defying him? Is
he directing all the sponsors toward Peeta? Is he just too
drunk to even notice what’s going on at the moment? Somehow
I don’t believe that and I don’t believe he’s trying to kill
me off by neglect, either. He has, in fact, in his own unpleasant
way, genuinely been trying to prepare me for this. Then what
is going on?
I bury my face in my hands. There’s no danger of tears now,
I couldn’t produce one to save my life. What is Haymitch
168
doing? Despite my anger, hatred, and suspicions, a small voice
in the back of my head whispers an answer.
Maybe he’s sending you a message, it says. A message. Saying
what? Then I know. There’s only one good reason Haymitch
could be withholding water from me. Because he knows
I’ve almost found it.
I grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet. My backpack
seems to have tripled in weight. I find a broken branch that
will do for a walking stick and I start off. The sun’s beating
down, even more searing than the first two days. I feel like an
old piece of leather, drying and cracking in the heat. every
step is an effort, but I refuse to stop. I refuse to sit down. If I
sit, there’s a good chance I won’t be able to get up again, that I
won’t even remember my task.
What easy prey I am! Any tribute, even tiny Rue, could take
me right now, merely shove me over and kill me with my own
knife, and I’d have little strength to resist. But if anyone is in
my part of the woods, they ignore me. The truth is, I feel a million
miles from another living soul.
Not alone though. No, they’ve surely got a camera tracking
me now. I think back to the years of watching tributes starve,
freeze, bleed, and dehydrate to death. Unless there’s a really
good fight going on somewhere, I’m being featured.
My thoughts turn to Prim. It’s likely she won’t be watching
me live, but they’ll show updates at the school during lunch.
For her sake, I try to look as least desperate as I can.
169
But by afternoon, I know the end is coming. My legs are
shaking and my heart too quick. I keep forgetting, exactly
what I’m doing. I’ve stumbled repeatedly and managed to regain
my feet, but when the stick slides out from under me, I finally
tumble to the ground unable to get up. I let my eyes
close.
I have misjudged Haymitch. He has no intention of helping
me at all.
This is all right, I think. This is not so bad here. The air is less
hot, signifying evening’s approach. There’s a slight, sweet
scent that reminds me of lilies. My fingers stroke the smooth
ground, sliding easily across the top. This is an okay place to
die, I think.
My fingertips make small swirling patterns in the cool,
slippery earth. I love mud, I think. How many times I’ve
tracked game with the help of its soft, readable surface. Good
for bee stings, too. Mud. Mud. Mud! My eyes fly open and I dig
my fingers into the earth. It is mud! My nose lifts in the air.
And those are lilies! Pond lilies!
I crawl now, through the mud, dragging myself toward the
scent. Five yards from where I fell, I crawl through a tangle of
plants into a pond. Floating on the top, yellow flowers in
bloom, are my beautiful lilies.
It’s all I can do not to plunge my face into the water and
gulp down as much as I can hold. But I have jus enough sense
left to abstain. With trembling hands, I get out my flask and fill
it with water. I add what I remember to be the right number of
170
drops of iodine for purifying it. The half an hour of waiting is
agony, but I do it. At least,
I think it’s a half an hour, but it’s certainly as long as I can
stand.
Slowly, easy now, I tell myself. I take one swallow and make
myself wait. Then another. Over the next couple of hours, I
drink the entire half gallon. Then a second. I prepare another
before I retire to a tree where I continue sipping, eating rabbit,
and even indulge in one of my precious crackers. By the
time the anthem plays, I feel remarkably better. There are no
faces tonight, no tributes died today. Tomorrow I’ll stay here,
resting, camouflaging my backpack with mud, catching some
of those little fish I saw as I sipped, digging up the roots of the
pond lilies to make a nice meal. I snuggle down in my sleeping
bag, hanging on to my water bottle for dear life, which, of
course, it is.
A few hours later, the stampede of feet shakes me from
slumber. I look around in bewilderment. It’s not yet dawn, but
my stinging eyes can see it.
It would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on me.
171
My first impulse is to scramble from the tree, but I’m belted
in. Somehow my fumbling fingers release the buckle and I fall
to the ground in a heap, still snarled in my sleeping bag.
There’s no time for any kind of packing. Fortunately, my
backpack and water bottle are already in the bag. I shove in
the belt, hoist the bag over my shoulder, and flee.
The world has transformed to flame and smoke. Burning
branches crack from trees and fall in showers of sparks at my
feet. All I can do is follow the others, the rabbits and deer and I
even spot a wild dog pack shooting through the woods. I trust
their sense of direction because their instincts are sharper
than mine. But they are much faster, flying through the underbrush
so gracefully as my boots catch on roots and fallen
tree limbs, that there’s no way I can keep apace with them.
The heat is horrible, but worse than the heat is the smoke,
which threatens to suffocate me at any moment. I pull the top
of my shirt up over my nose, grateful to find it soaked in
sweat, and it offers a thin veil of protection. And I run, choking,
my bag banging against my back, my face cut with
branches that materialize from the gray haze without warning,
because I know I am supposed to run.
172
This was no tribute’s campfire gone out of control, no accidental
occurrence. The flames that bear down on me have an
unnatural height, a uniformity that marks them as humanmade,
machine-made, Gamemaker-made. Things have been
too quiet today. No deaths, perhaps no fights at all. The audience
in the Capitol will be getting bored, claiming that these
Games are verging on dullness. This is the one thing the
Games must not do.
It’s not hard to follow the Gamemakers’ motivation. There
is the Career pack and then there are the rest of us, probably
spread far and thin across the arena. This fire is designed to
flush us out, to drive us together. It may not be the most original
device I’ve seen, but it’s very, very effective.
I hurdle over a burning log. Not high enough. The tail end of
my jacket catches on fire and I have to stop to rip it from my
body and stamp out the flames. But I don’t dare leave the
jacket, scorched and smoldering as it is, I take the risk of shoving
it in my sleeping bag, hoping the lack of air will quell what
I haven’t extinguished. This is all I have, what I carry on my
back, and it’s little enough to survive with.
In a matter of minutes, my throat and nose are burning. The
coughing begins soon after and my lungs begin to feel as if
they are actually being cooked. Discomfort turns to distress
until each breath sends a searing pain through my chest. I
manage to take cover under a stone outcropping just as the
vomiting begins, and I lose my meager supper and whatever
water has remained in my stomach. Crouching on my hands
and knees, I retch until there’s nothing left to come up.
173
I know I need to keep moving, but I’m trembling and lightheaded
now, gasping for air. I allow myself about a spoonful of
water to rinse my mouth and spit then take a few swallows
from my bottle. You get one minute, I tell myself. One minute to
rest. I take the time to reorder my supplies, wad up the sleeping
bag, and messily stuff everything into the backpack. My
minute’s up. I know it’s time to move on, but the smoke has
clouded my thoughts. The swift-footed animals that were my
compass have left me behind. I know I haven’t been in this
part of the woods before, there were no sizable rocks like the
one I’m sheltering against on my earlier travels. Where are the
Gamemakers driving me? Back to the lake? To a whole new
terrain filled with new dangers? I had just found a few hours
of peace at the pond when this attack began. Would there be
any way I could travel parallel to the fire and work my way
back there, to a source of water at least? The wall of fire must
have an end and it won’t burn indefinitely. Not because the
Gamemakers couldn’t keep it fueled but because, again, that
would invite accusations of boredom from the audience. If I
could get back behind the fire line, I could avoid meeting up
with the Careers. I’ve just decided to try and loop back
around, although it will require miles of travel away from the
inferno and then a very circuitous route back, when the first
fireball blasts into the rock about two feet from my head. I
spring out from under my ledge, energized by renewed fear.
The game has taken a twist. The fire was just to get us moving,
now the audience will get to see some real fun. When I
hear the next hiss, I flatten on the ground, not taking time to
174
look. The fireball hits a tree off to my left, engulfing it in
flames. To remain still is death. I’m barely on my feet before
the third ball hits the ground where I was lying, sending a pillar
of fire up behind me. Time loses meaning now as I frantically
try to dodge the attacks. I can’t see where they’re being
launched from, but it’s not a hovercraft. The angles are not extreme
enough. Probably this whole segment of the woods has
been armed with precision launchers that are concealed in
trees or rocks. Somewhere, in a cool and spotless room, a Gamemaker
sits at a set of controls, fingers on the triggers that
could end my life in a second. All that is needed is a direct hit.
Whatever vague plan I had conceived regarding returning
to my pond is wiped from my mind as I zigzag and dive and
leap to avoid the fireballs. Each one is only the size of an apple,
but packs tremendous power on contact. Every sense I
have goes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over.
There’s no time to judge if a move is the correct one. When
there’s a hiss, I act or die.
Something keeps me moving forward, though. A lifetime of
watching the Hunger Games lets me know that certain areas
of the arena are rigged for certain attacks. And that if I can just
get away from this section, I might be able to move out of
reach of the launchers. I might also then fall straight into a pit
of vipers, but I can’t worry about that now.
How long I scramble along dodging the fireballs I can’t say,
but the attacks finally begin to abate. Which is good, because
I’m retching again. This time it’s an acidic substance that
scalds my throat and makes its way into my nose as well. I’m
175
forced to stop as my body convulses, trying desperately to rid
itself of the poisons I’ve been sucking in during the attack. I
wait for the next hiss, the next signal to bolt. It doesn’t come.
The force of the retching has squeezed tears out of my stinging
eyes. My clothes are drenched in sweat. Somehow,
through the smoke and vomit, I pick up the scent of singed
hair. My hand fumbles to my braid and finds a fireball has
seared off at least six inches of it. Strands of blackened hair
crumble in my fingers. I stare at them, fascinated by the transformation,
when the hissing registers.
My muscles react, only not fast enough this time. The fireball
crashes into the ground at my side, but not before it skids
across my right calf. Seeing my pants leg on fire sends me over
the edge. I twist and scuttle backward on my hands and feet,
shrieking, trying to remove myself from the horror. When I finally
regain enough sense, I roll the leg back and forth on the
ground, which stifles the worst of it. But then, without thinking,
I rip away the remaining fabric with my bare hands.
I sit on the ground, a few yards from the blaze set off by the
fireball. My calf is screaming, my hands covered in red welts.
I’m shaking too hard to move. If the Gamemakers want to
finish me off, now is the time.
I hear Cinna’s voice, carrying images of rich fabric and
sparkling gems. Katniss, the girl who was on fire. What a
good laugh the Gamemakers must be having over that one.
Perhaps, Cinna’s beautiful costumes have even brought on this
particular torture for me. I know he couldn’t have foreseen
this, must be hurting for me because, in fact, I believe he cares
176
about me. But all in all, maybe showing up stark naked in that
chariot would have been safer for me.
The attack is now over. The Gamemakers don’t want me
dead. Not yet anyway. Everyone knows they could destroy us
all within seconds of the opening gong. The real sport of the
Hunger Games is watching the tributes kill one another. Every
so often, they do kill a tribute just to remind the players they
can. But mostly, they manipulate us into confronting one
another face-to-face. Which means, if I am no longer being
fired at, there is at least one other tribute close at hand.
I would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if I
could, but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me. I make
myself stand and begin to limp away from the wall of flames
that lights up the sky. It does not seem to be pursuing me any
longer, except with its stinking black clouds.
Another light, daylight, begins to softly emerge. Swirls of
smoke catch the sunbeams. My visibility is poor. I can see
maybe fifteen yards in any direction. A tribute could easily be
concealed from me here. I should draw my knife as a precaution,
but I doubt my ability to hold it for long. The pain in my
hands can in no way compete with that in my calf. I hate
burns, have always hated them, even a small one gotten from
pulling a pan of bread from the oven. It is the worst kind of
pain to me, but I have never experienced anything like this.
I’m so weary I don’t even notice I’m in the pool until I’m
ankle-deep. It’s spring-fed, bubbling up out of a crevice in
some rocks, and blissfully cool. I plunge my hands into the
shallow water and feel instant relief. Isn’t that what my moth-
177
er always says? The first treatment for a burn is cold water?
That it draws out the heat? But she means minor burns. Probably
she’d recommend it for my hands. But what of my calf?
Although I have not yet had the courage to examine it, I’m
guessing that it’s an injury in a whole different class.
I lie on my stomach at edge of the pool for a while, dangling
my hands in the water, examining the little flames on my fingernails
that are beginning to chip off. Good. I’ve had enough
fire for a lifetime.
I bathe the blood and ash from my face. I try to recall all I
know about burns. They are common injuries in the Seam
where we cook and heat our homes with coal. Then there are
the mine accidents. . . . A family once brought in an unconscious
young man pleading with my mother to help him. The
district doctor who’s responsible for treating the miners had
written him off, told the family to take him home to die. But
they wouldn’t accept this. He lay on our kitchen table, senseless
to the world. I got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh,
gaping, charred flesh, burned clear down to the bone, before I
ran from the house. I went to the woods and hunted the entire
day, haunted by the gruesome leg, memories of my father’s
death. What’s funny was, Prim, who’s scared of her own shadow,
stayed and helped. My mother says healers are born, not
made. They did their best, but the man died, just like the doctor
said he would.
My leg is in need of attention, but I still can’t look at it.
What if it’s as bad as the man’s and I can see my bone? Then I
remember my mother saying that if a burn’s severe, the victim
178
might not even feel pain because the nerves would be destroyed.
Encouraged by this, I sit up and swing my leg in front
of me.
I almost faint at the sight of my calf. The flesh is a brilliant
red covered with blisters. I force myself to take deep, slow
breaths, feeling quite certain the cameras are on my face. I
can’t show weakness at this injury. Not if I want help. Pity
does not get you aid. Admiration at your refusal to give in
does. I cut the remains of the pant leg off at the knee and examine
the injury more closely. The burned area is about the
size of my hand. None of the skin is blackened. I think it’s not
too bad to soak. Gingerly I stretch out my leg into the pool,
propping the heel of my boot on a rock so the leather doesn’t
get too sodden, and sigh, because this does offer some relief. I
know there are herbs, if I could find them, that would speed
the healing, but I can’t quite call them to mind. Water and time
will probably be all I have to work with.
Should I be moving on? The smoke is slowly clearing but
still too heavy to be healthy. If I do continue away from the
fire, won’t I be walking straight into the weapons of the Careers?
Besides, every time I lift my leg from the water, the
pain rebounds so intensely I have to slide it back in. My hands
are slightly less demanding. They can handle small breaks
from the pool. So I slowly put my gear back in order. First I fill
my bottle with the pool water, treat it, and when enough time
has passed, begin to rehydrate my body. After a time, I force
myself to nibble on a cracker, which helps settle my stomach. I
roll up my sleeping bag. Except for a few black marks, it’s rela-
179
tively unscathed. My jacket’s another matter. Stinking and
scorched, at least a foot of the back beyond repair. I cut off the
damaged area leaving me with a garment that comes just to
the bottom of my ribs. But the hood’s intact and it’s far better
than nothing.
Despite the pain, drowsiness begins to take over. I’d take to
a tree and try to rest, except I’d be too easy to spot. Besides,
abandoning my pool seems impossible. I neatly arrange my
supplies, even settle my pack on my shoulders, but I can’t
seem to leave. I spot some water plants with edible roots and
make a small meal with my last piece of rabbit. Sip water.
Watch the sun make its slow arc across the sky. Where would
I go anyway that is any safer than here? I lean back on my
pack, overcome by drowsiness. If the Careers want me, let
them find me, I think before drifting into a stupor. Let them
find me.
And find me, they do. It’s lucky I’m ready to move on because
when I hear the feet, I have less than a minute head
start. Evening has begun to fall. The moment I awake, I’m up
and running, splashing across the pool, flying into the underbrush.
My leg slows me down, but I sense my pursuers are not
as speedy as they were before the fire, either. I hear their
coughs, their raspy voices calling to one another.
Still, they are closing in, just like a pack of wild dogs, and so
I do what I have done my whole life in such circumstances. I
pick a high tree and begin to climb. If running hurt, climbing is
agonizing because it requires not only exertion but direct contact
of my hands on the tree bark. I’m fast, though, and by the
180
time they’ve reached the base of my trunk, I’m twenty feet up.
For a moment, we stop and survey one another. I hope they
can’t hear the pounding of my heart.
This could be it, I think. What chance do I have against
them? All six are there, the five Careers and Peeta, and my only
consolation is they’re pretty beat-up, too. Even so, look at
their weapons. Look at their faces, grinning and snarling at
me, a sure kill above them. It seems pretty hopeless. But then
something else registers. They’re bigger and stronger than I
am, no doubt, but they’re also heavier. There’s a reason it’s me
and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit, or rob
the most remote bird nests. I must weigh at least fifty or sixty
pounds less than the smallest Career.
Now I smile. How’s everything with you? I call down
cheerfully.
This takes them aback, but I know the crowd will love it.
Well enough, says the boy from District 2. Yourself?
It’s been a bit warm for my taste, I say. I can almost hear
the laughter from the Capitol. The air’s better up here. Why
don’t you come on up?
Think I will, says the same boy.
Here, take this, Cato, says the girl from District 1, and she
offers him the silver bow and sheath of arrows. My bow! My
arrows! Just the sight of them makes me so angry I want to
scream, at myself, at that traitor Peeta for distracting me from
having them. I try to make eye contact with him now, but he
seems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he polishes his
knife with the edge of his shirt.
181
No, says Cato, pushing away the bow. I’ll do better with
my sword. I can see the weapon, a short, heavy blade at his
belt.
I give Cato time to hoist himself into the tree before I begin
to climb again. Gale always says I remind him of a squirrel the
way I can scurry up even the slenderest limb. Part of it’s my
weight, but part of it’s practice. You have to know where to
place your hands and feet. I’m another thirty feet in the air
when I hear the crack and look down to see Cato flailing as he
and a branch go down. He hits the ground hard and I’m hoping
he possibly broke his neck when he gets back to his feet,
swearing like a fiend.
The girl with the arrows, Glimmer I hear someone call her
— ugh, the names the people in District 1 give their children
are so ridiculous — anyway Glimmer scales the tree until the
branches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good
sense to stop. I’m at least eighty feet high now. She tries to
shoot me and it’s immediately evident that she’s incompetent
with a bow. One of the arrows gets lodged in the tree near me
though and I’m able to seize it. I wave it teasingly above her
head, as if this was the sole purpose of retrieving it, when actually
I mean to use it if I ever get the chance. I could kill them,
everyone of them, if those silver weapons were in my hands.
The Careers regroup on the ground and I can hear them
growling conspiratorially among themselves, furious I have
made them look foolish. But twilight has arrived and their
window of attack on me is closing. Finally, I hear Peeta say
182
harshly, Oh, let her stay up there. It’s not like she’s going anywhere.
We’ll deal with her in the morning.
Well, he’s right about one thing. I’m going nowhere. All the
relief from the pool water has gone, leaving me to feel the full
potency of my burns. I scoot down to a fork in the tree and
clumsily prepare for bed. Put on my jacket. Lay out my sleeping
bed. Belt myself in and try to keep from moaning. The heat
of the bag’s too much for my leg. I cut a slash in the fabric and
hang my calf out in the open air. I drizzle water on the wound,
my hands.
All my bravado is gone. I’m weak from pain and hunger but
can’t bring myself to eat. Even if I can last the night, what will
the morning bring? I stare into the foliage trying to will myself
to rest, but the burns forbid it. Birds are settling down for the
night, singing lullabies to their young. Night creatures emerge.
An owl hoots. The faint scent of a skunk cuts through the
smoke. The eyes of some animal peer at me from the neighboring
tree — a possum maybe — catching the firelight from
the Careers’ torches. Suddenly, I’m up on one elbow. Those
are no possum’s eyes, I know their glassy reflection too well.
In fact, those are not animal eyes at all. In the last dim rays of
light, I make her out, watching me silently from between the
branches. Rue.
How long has she been here? The whole time probably. Still
and unobserved as the action unfolded beneath her. Perhaps
she headed up her tree shortly before I did, hearing the pack
was so close.
183
For a while we hold each other’s gaze. Then, without even
rustling a leaf, her little hand slides into the open and points
to something above my head.
184
My eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage
above me. At first, I have no idea what she’s pointing to, but
then, about fifteen feet up, I make out the vague shape in the
dimming light. But of . . . of what? Some sort of animal? It looks
about the size of a raccoon, but it hangs from the bottom of a
branch, swaying ever so slightly. There’s something else.
Among the familiar evening sounds of the woods, my ears register
a low hum. Then I know. It’s a wasp nest.
Fear shoots through me, but I have enough sense to keep
still. After all, I don’t know what kind of wasp lives there. It
could be the ordinary leave-us-alone-and-we’ll-leave-youalone
type. But these are the Hunger Games, and ordinary isn’t
the norm. More likely they will be one of the Capitol’s muttations,
tracker jackers. Like the jabberjays, these killer wasps
were spawned in a lab and strategically placed, like land
mines, around the districts during the war. Larger than regular
wasps, they have a distinctive solid gold body and a sting
that raises a lump the size of a plum on contact. Most people
can’t tolerate more than a few stings. Some die at once. If you
live, the hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually
driven people to madness. And there’s another thing, these
wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs their nest and at-
185
tempt to kill them. That’s where the tracker part of the name
comes from.
After the war, the Capitol destroyed all the nests surrounding
their city, but the ones near the districts were left untouched.
Another reminder of our weakness, I suppose, just
like the Hunger Games. Another reason to keep inside the
fence of District 12. When Gale and I come across a tracker
jacker nest, we immediately head in the opposite direction.
So is that what hangs above me? I look back to Rue for help,
but she’s melted into her tree.
Given my circumstances, I guess it doesn’t matter what
type of wasp nest it is. I’m wounded and trapped. Darkness
has given me a brief reprieve, but by the time the sun rises,
the Careers will have formulated a plan to kill me. There’s no
way they could do otherwise after I’ve made them look so
stupid. That nest may be the sole option I have left. If I can
drop it down on them, I may be able to escape. But I’ll risk my
life in the process.
Of course, I’ll never be able to get in close enough to the actual
nest to cut it free. I’ll have to saw off the branch at the
trunk and send the whole thing down. The serrated portion of
my knife should be able to manage that. But can my hands?
And will the vibration from the sawing raise the swarm? And
what if the Careers figure out what I’m doing and move their
camp? That would defeat the whole purpose.
I realize that the best chance I’ll have to do the sawing
without drawing notice will be during the anthem. That could
begin any time. I drag myself out of my bag, make sure my
186
knife is secured in my belt, and begin to make my way up the
tree. This in itself is dangerous since the branches are becoming
precariously thin even for me, but I persevere. When I
reach the limb that supports the nest, the humming becomes
more distinctive. But it’s still oddly subdued if these are tracker
jackers. It’s the smoke, I think. It’s sedated them. This was
the one defense the rebels found to battle the wasps.
The seal of the Capitol shines above me and the anthem
blares out. It’s now or never, I think, and begin to saw. Blisters
burst on my right hand as I awkwardly drag the knife back
and forth. Once I’ve got a groove, the work requires less effort
but is almost more than I can handle. I grit my teeth and saw
away occasionally glancing at the sky to register that there
were no deaths today. That’s all right. The audience will be
sated seeing me injured and treed and the pack below me. But
the anthem’s running out and I’m only three quarters of the
way through the wood when the music ends, the sky goes
dark, and I’m forced to stop.
Now what? I could probably finish off the job by sense of
feel but that may not be the smartest plan. If the wasps are too
groggy, if the nest catches on its way down, if I try to escape,
this could all be a deadly waste of time. Better, I think, to
sneak up here at dawn and send the nest into my enemies.
In the faint light of the Careers’ torches, I inch back down to
my fork to find the best surprise I’ve ever had. Sitting on my
sleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver parachute.
My first gift from a sponsor! Haymitch must have had it
sent in during the anthem. The pot easily fits in the palm of my
187
hand. What can it be? Not food surely. I unscrew the lid and I
know by the scent that it’s medicine. Cautiously, I probe the
surface of the ointment. The throbbing in my fingertip vanishes.
Oh, Haymitch, I whisper. Thank you. He has not abandoned
me. Not left me to fend entirely for myself. The cost of
this medicine must be astronomical. Probably not one but
many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot. To
me, it is priceless.
I dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over
my calf. The effect is almost magical, erasing the pain on contact,
leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind. This is no
herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland
plants, it’s high-tech medicine brewed up in the Capitol’s labs.
When my calf is treated, I rub a thin layer into my hands. After
wrapping the pot in the parachute, I nestle it safely away in
my pack. Now that the pain has eased, it’s all I can do to reposition
myself in my bag before I plunge into sleep.
A bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new
day is dawning. In the gray morning light, I examine my hands.
The medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a
soft baby-skin pink. My leg still feels inflamed, but that burn
was far deeper. I apply another coat of medicine and quietly
pack up my gear. Whatever happens, I’m going to have to
move and move fast. I also make myself eat a cracker and a
strip of beef and drink a few cups of water.
Almost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday, and I’m
already starting to feel the effects of hunger.
188
Below me, I can see the Career pack and Peeta asleep on
the ground. By her position, leaning up against the trunk of
the tree, I’d guess Glimmer was supposed to be on guard, but
fatigue overcame her.
My eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me,
but I can’t make out Rue. Since she tipped me off, it only seems
fair to warn her. Besides, if I’m going to die today, it’s Rue I
want to win. Even if it means a little extra food for my family,
the idea of Peeta being crowned victor is unbearable.
I call Rue’s name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear,
wide and alert, at once. She points up to the nest again. I hold
up my knife and make a sawing motion. She nods and disappears.
There’s a rustling in a nearby tree. Then the same noise
again a bit farther off. I realize she’s leaping from tree to tree.
It’s all I can do not to laugh out loud. Is this what she showed
the Gamemakers? I imagine her flying around the training
equipment never touching the floor. She should have gotten at
least a ten.
Rosy streaks are breaking through in the east. I can’t afford
to wait any longer. Compared to the agony of last night’s
climb, this one is a cinch. At the tree limb that holds the nest, I
position the knife in the groove and I’m about to draw the
teeth across the wood when I see something moving. There,
on the nest. The bright gold gleam of a tracker jacker lazily
making its way across the papery gray surface. No question,
it’s acting a little subdued, but the wasp is up and moving and
that means the others will be out soon as well. Sweat breaks
out on the palms of my hands, beading up through the oint-
189
ment, and I do my best to pat them dry on my shirt. If I don’t
get through this branch in a matter of seconds, the entire
swarm could emerge and attack me.
There’s no sense in putting it off. I take a deep breath, grip
the knife handle and bear down as hard as I can. Back, forth,
back, forth! The tracker jackers begin to buzz and I hear them
coming out. Back, forth, back, forth! A stabbing pain shoots
through my knee and I know one has found me and the others
will be honing in. Back, forth, back, forth. And just as the knife
cuts through, I shove the end of the branch as far away from
me as I can. It crashes down through the lower branches,
snagging temporarily on a few but then twisting free until it
smashes with a thud on the ground. The nest bursts open like
an egg, and a furious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air.
I feel a second sting on the cheek, a third on my neck, and
their venom almost immediately makes me woozy. I cling to
the tree with one arm while I rip the barbed stingers out of my
flesh. Fortunately, only these three tracker jackers had identified
me before the nest went down. The rest of the insects
have targeted their enemies on the ground.
It’s mayhem. The Careers have woken to a full-scale tracker
jacker attack. Peeta and a few others have the sense to drop
everything and bolt. I can hear cries of To the lake! To the
lake! and know they hope to evade the wasps by taking to the
water. It must be close if they think they can outdistance the
furious insects. Glimmer and another girl, the one from District
4, are not so lucky. They receive multiple stings before
they’re even out of my view. Glimmer appears to go complete-
190
ly mad, shrieking and trying to bat the wasps off with her bow,
which is pointless. She calls to the others for help but, of
course, no one returns. The girl from District 4 staggers out of
sight, although I wouldn’t bet on her making it to the lake. I
watch Glimmer fall, twitch hysterically around on the ground
for a few minutes, and then go still.
The nest is nothing but an empty shell. The wasps have vanished
in pursuit of the others. I don’t think they’ll return, but
I don’t want to risk it. I scamper down the tree and hit the
ground running in the opposite direction of the lake. The poison
from the stingers makes me wobbly, but I find my way
back to my own little pool and submerge myself in the water,
just in case any wasps are still on my trail. After about five
minutes, I drag myself onto the rocks. People have not exaggerated
the effects of the tracker jacker stings. Actually, the one
on my knee is closer to an orange than a plum in size. A foulsmelling
green liquid oozes from the places where I pulled out
the stingers.
The swelling. The pain. The ooze. Watching Glimmer
twitching to death on the ground. It’s a lot to handle before
the sun has even cleared the horizon. I don’t want to think
about what Glimmer must look like now. Her body disfigured.
Her swollen fingers stiffening around the bow . . .
The bow! Somewhere in my befuddled mind one thought
connects to another and I’m on my feet, teetering through the
trees back to Glimmer. The bow. The arrows. I must get them.
I haven’t heard the cannons fire yet, so perhaps Glimmer is in
some sort of coma, her heart still struggling against the wasp
191
venom. But once it stops and the cannon signals her death, a
hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body, taking the only
bow and sheath of arrows I’ve seen out of the Games for good.
And I refuse to let them slip through my fingers again!
I reach Glimmer just as the cannon fires. The tracker jackers
have vanished. This girl, so breathtakingly beautiful in her
golden dress the night of the interviews, is unrecognizable.
Her features eradicated, her limbs three times their normal
size. The stinger lumps have begun to explode, spewing putrid
green liquid around her. I have to break several of what used
to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow. The sheath of
arrows is pinned under her back. I try to roll over her body by
pulling on one arm, but the flesh disintegrates in my hands
and I fall back on the ground.
Is this real? Or have the hallucinations begun? I squeeze my
eyes tight and try to breathe through my mouth, ordering myself
not to become sick. Breakfast must stay down, it might be
days before I can hunt again. A second cannon fires and I’m
guessing the girl from District 4 has just died. I hear the birds
fall silent and then one give the warning call, which means a
hovercraft is about to appear. Confused, I think it’s for Glimmer,
although this doesn’t quite make sense because I’m still
in the picture, still fighting for the arrows. I lurch back onto
my knees and the trees around me begin to spin in circles. In
the middle of the sky, I spot the hovercraft. I throw myself
over Glimmer’s body as if to protect it but then I see the girl
from District 4 being lifted into the air and vanishing.
192
Do this! I command myself. Clenching my jaw, I dig my
hands under Glimmer’s body, get a hold on what must be her
rib cage, and force her onto her stomach. I can’t help it, I’m
hyperventilating now, the whole thing is so nightmarish and
I’m losing my grasp on what’s real. I tug on the silver sheath of
arrows, but it’s caught on something, her shoulder blade,
something, and finally yank it free. I’ve just encircled the
sheath with my arms when I hear the footsteps, several pairs,
coming through the underbrush, and I realize the Careers
have come back. They’ve come back to kill me or get their
weapons or both.
But it’s too late to run. I pull a slimy arrow from the sheath
and try to position it on the bowstring but instead of one
string I see three and the stench from the stings is so repulsive
I can’t do it. I can’t do it. I can’t do it.
I’m helpless as the first hunter crashes through the trees,
spear lifted, poised to throw. The shock on Peeta’s face makes
no sense to me. I wait for the blow. Instead his arm drops to
his side.
What are you still doing here? he hisses at me. I stare uncomprehendingly
as a trickle of water drips off a sting under
his ear. His whole body starts sparkling as if he’s been dipped
in dew. Are you mad? He’s prodding me with the shaft of the
spear now. Get up! Get up! I rise, but he’s still pushing at me.
What? What is going on? He shoves me away from him hard.
Run! he screams. Run!
Behind him, Cato slashes his way through the brush. He’s
sparkling wet, too, and badly stung under one eye. I catch the
193
gleam of sunlight on his sword and do as Peeta says. Holding
tightly to my bow and arrows, banging into trees that appear
out of nowhere, tripping and falling as I try to keep my balance.
Back past my pool and into unfamiliar woods. The world
begins to bend in alarming ways. A butterfly balloons to the
size of a house then shatters into a million stars. Trees transform
to blood and splash down over my boots. Ants begin to
crawl out of the blisters on my hands and I can’t shake them
free. They’re climbing up my arms, my neck. Someone’s
screaming, a long high pitched scream that never breaks for
breath. I have a vague idea it might be me. I trip and fall into a
small pit lined with tiny orange bubbles that hum like the
tracker jacker nest. Tucking my knees up to my chin, I wait for
death.
Sick and disoriented, I’m able to form only one thought:
Peeta Mellark just saved my life.
Then the ants bore into my eyes and I black out.
194
I enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only to
find a greater terror awaiting me. All the things I dread most,
all the things I dread for others manifest in such vivid detail I
can’t help but believe they’re real. Each time I wake, I think, At
last, this is over, but it isn’t. It’s only the beginning of a new
chapter of torture. How many ways do I watch Prim die? Relive
my father’s last moments? Feel my own body ripped
apart? This is the nature of the tracker jacker venom, so carefully
created to target the place where fear lives in your brain.
When I finally do come to my senses, I lie still, waiting for
the next onslaught of imagery. But eventually I accept that the
poison must have finally worked its way out of my system,
leaving my body wracked and feeble. I’m still lying on my side,
locked in the fetal position. I lift a hand to my eyes to find
them sound, untouched by ants that never existed. Simply
stretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort. So many
parts of me hurt, it doesn’t seem worthwhile taking inventory
of them. Very, very slowly I manage to sit up. I’m in a shallow
hole, not filled with the humming orange bubbles of my hallucination
but with old, dead leaves. My clothing’s damp, but I
don’t know whether pond water, dew, rain, or sweat is the
cause. For a long time, all I can do is take tiny sips from my
195
bottle and watch a beetle crawl up the side of a honeysuckle
bush.
How long have I been out? It was morning when I lost reason.
Now it’s afternoon. But the stiffness in my joints suggests
more than a day has passed, even two possibly. If so, I’ll have
no way of knowing which tributes survived that tracker jacker
attack. Not Glimmer or the girl from District 4. But there was
the boy from District 1, both tributes from District 2, and Peeta.
Did they die from the stings? Certainly if they lived, their
last days must have been as horrid as my own. And what
about Rue? She’s so small, it wouldn’t take much venom to do
her in. But then again . . . the tracker jackers would’ve had to
catch her, and she had a good head start.
A foul, rotten taste pervades my mouth, and the water has
little effect on it. I drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush
and pluck a flower. I gently pull the stamen through the blossom
and set the drop of nectar on my tongue. The sweetness
spreads through my mouth, down my throat, warming my
veins with memories of summer, and my home woods and
Gale’s presence beside me. For some reason, our discussion
from that last morning comes back to me.
We could do it, you know.
What?
Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we
could make it.
And suddenly, I’m not thinking of Gale but of Peeta and . . .
Peeta! He saved my life! I think. Because by the time we met
up, I couldn’t tell what was real and what the tracker jacker
196
venom had caused me to imagine. But if he did, and my instincts
tell me he did, what for? Is he simply working the Lover
Boy angle he initiated at the interview? Or was he actually
trying to protect me? And if he was, what was he doing with
those Careers in the first place? None of it makes sense.
I wonder what Gale made of the incident for a moment and
then I push the whole thing out of my mind because for some
reason Gale and Peeta do not coexist well together in my
thoughts.
So I focus on the one really good thing that’s happened
since I landed in the arena. I have a bow and arrows! A full
dozen arrows if you count the one I retrieved in the tree. They
bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from
Glimmer’s body — which leads me to believe that might not
have been wholly real — but they have a fair amount of dried
blood on them. I can clean them later, but I do take a minute to
shoot a few into a nearby tree. They are more like the weapons
in the Training Center than my ones at home, but who
cares? That I can work with.
The weapons give me an entirely new perspective on the
Games. I know I have tough opponents left to face. But I am no
longer merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate
measures. If Cato broke through the trees right now, I
wouldn’t flee, I’d shoot. I find I’m actually anticipating the
moment with pleasure.
But first, I have to get some strength back in my body. I’m
very dehydrated again and my water supply is dangerously
low. The little padding I was able to put on by gorging myself
197
during prep time in the Capitol is gone, plus several more
pounds as well. My hip bones and ribs are more prominent
than I remember them being since those awful months after
my father’s death. And then there are my wounds to contend
with — burns, cuts, and bruises from smashing into the trees,
and three tracker jacker stings, which are as sore and swollen
as ever. I treat my burns with the ointment and try dabbing a
bit on my stings as well, but it has no effect on them. My
mother knew a treatment for them, some type of leaf that
could draw out the poison, but she seldom had cause to use it,
and I don’t even remember its name let alone its appearance.
Water first, I think. You can hunt along the way now. It’s
easy to see the direction I came from by the path of destruction
my crazed body made through the foliage. So I walk off in
the other direction, hoping my enemies still lie locked in the
surreal world of tracker jacker venom.
I can’t move too quickly, my joints reject any abrupt motions.
But I establish the slow hunter’s tread I use when tracking
game. Within a few minutes, I spot a rabbit and make my
first kill with the bow and arrow. It’s not my usual clean shot
through the eye, but I’ll take it. After about an hour, I find a
stream, shallow but wide, and more than sufficient for my
needs. The sun’s hot and severe, so while I wait for my water
to purify I strip down to my underclothes and wade into the
mild current. I’m filthy from head to toe, I try splashing myself
but eventually just lay down in the water for a few minutes,
letting it wash off the soot and blood and skin that has started
to peel off my burns. After rinsing out my clothes and hanging
198
them on bushes to dry, I sit on the bank in the sun for a bit,
untangling my hair with my fingers. My appetite returns and I
eat a cracker and a strip of beef. With a handful of moss, I
polish the blood from my silver weapons.
Refreshed, I treat my burns again, braid back my hair, and
dress in the damp clothes, knowing the sun will dry them soon
enough. Following the stream against its current seems the
smartest course of action. I’m traveling uphill now, which I
prefer, with a source of fresh water not only for myself but
possible game. I easily take out a strange bird that must be
some form of wild turkey. Anyway, it looks plenty edible to
me. By late afternoon, I decide to build a small fire to cook the
meat, betting that dusk will help conceal the smoke and I can
quench the fire by nightfall. I clean the game, taking extra care
with the bird, but there’s nothing alarming about it. Once the
feathers are plucked, it’s no bigger than a chicken, but it’s
plump and firm. I’ve just placed the first lot over the coals
when I hear the twig snap.
In one motion, I turn to the sound, bringing the bow and arrow
to my shoulder. There’s no one there. No one I can see
anyway. Then I spot the tip of a child’s boot just peeking out
from behind the trunk of a tree. My shoulders relax and I grin.
She can move through the woods like a shadow, you have to
give her that. How else could she have followed me? The
words come out of my mouth before I can stop them.
You know, they’re not the only ones who can form alliances,
I say.
199
For a moment, no response. Then one of Rue’s eyes edges
around the trunk. You want me for an ally?
Why not? You saved me with those tracker jackers. You’re
smart enough to still be alive. And I can’t seem to shake you
anyway, I say. She blinks at me, trying to decide. You hungry?
I can see her swallow hard, her eye flickering to the
meat. Come on then, I’ve had two kills today.
Rue tentatively steps out into the open. I can fix your
stings.
Can you? I ask. How?
She digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a handful of
leaves. I’m almost certain they’re the ones my mother uses.
Where’d you find those?
Just around. We all carry them when we work in the orchards.
They left a lot of nests there, says Rue. There are a lot
here, too.
That’s right. You’re District Eleven. Agriculture, I say.
Orchards, huh? That must be how you can fly around the
trees like you’ve got wings. Rue smiles. I’ve landed on one of
the few things she’ll admit pride in. Well, come on, then. Fix
me up.
I plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to reveal
the sting on my knee. To my surprise, Rue places the handful
of leaves into her mouth and begins to chew them. My mother
would use other methods, but it’s not like we have a lot of options.
After a minute or so, Rue presses a gloppy green wad of
chewed leaves and spit on my knee.
200
Ohhh. The sound comes out of my mouth before I can
stop it. It’s as if the leaves are actually leaching the pain right
out of the sting.
Rue gives a giggle. Lucky you had the sense to pull the
stingers out or you’d be a lot worse.
Do my neck! Do my cheek! I almost beg.
Rue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth, and soon
I’m laughing because the relief is so sweet. I notice a long burn
on Rue’s forearm. I’ve got something for that. I set aside my
weapons and anoint her arm with the burn medicine.
You have good sponsors, she says longingly.
Have you gotten anything yet? I ask. She shakes her head.
You will, though. Watch. The closer we get to the end, the
more people will realize how clever you are. I turn the meat
over.
You weren’t joking, about wanting me for an ally? she
asks.
No, I meant it, I say. I can almost hear Haymitch groaning
as I team up with this wispy child. But I want her. Because
she’s a survivor, and I trust her, and why not admit it? She
reminds me of Prim.
Okay, she says, and holds out her hand. We shake. It’s a
deal.
Of course, this kind of deal can only be temporary, but neither
of us mentions that.
Rue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy root
to the meal. Roasted over the fire, they have the sharp sweet
taste of a parsnip. She recognizes the bird, too, some wild
201
thing they call a groosling in her district. She says sometimes a
flock will wander into the orchard and they get a decent lunch
that day. For a while, all conversation stops as we fill our stomachs.
The groosling has delicious meal that’s so fatty, the
grease drips down your face when you bite into it.
Oh, says Rue with a sigh. I’ve never had a whole leg to
myself before.
I’ll bet she hasn’t. I’ll bet meat hardly ever comes her way.
Take the other, I say.
Really? she asks.
Take whatever you want. Now that I’ve got a bow and arrows,
I can get more. Plus I’ve got snares. I can show you how
to set them, I say. Rue still looks uncertainly at the leg. Oh,
take it, I say, putting the drumstick in her hands. It will only
keep a few days anyway, and we’ve got the whole bird plus
the rabbit. Once she’s got hold of it, her appetite wins out and
she takes a huge mouthful.
I’d have thought, in District Eleven, you’d have a bit more
to eat than us. You know, since you grow the food, I say.
Rue’s eyes widen. Oh, no, we’re not allowed to eat the
crops.
They arrest you or something? I ask.
They whip you and make everyone else watch, says Rue.
The mayor’s very strict about it.
I can tell by her expression that it’s not that uncommon an
occurrence. A public whipping’s a rare thing in District 12, although
occasionally one occurs. Technically, Gale and I could
be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods — well,
202
technically, we could get a whole lot worse — except all the
officials buy our meat. Besides, our mayor, Madge’s father,
doesn’t seem to have much taste for such events. Maybe being
the least prestigious, poorest, most ridiculed district in the
country has its advantages. Such as, being largely ignored by
the Capitol as long as we produce our coal quotas.
Do you get all the coal you want? Rue asks.
No, I answer. Just what we buy and whatever we track in
on our boots.
They feed us a bit extra during harvest, so that people can
keep going longer, says Rue.
Don’t you have to be in school? I ask.
Not during harvest. Everyone works then, says Rue.
It’s interesting, hearing about her life. We have so little
communication with anyone outside our district. In fact, I
wonder if the Gamemakers are blocking out our conversation,
because even though the information seems harmless, they
don’t want people in different districts to know about one
another.
At Rue’s suggestion, we lay out all our food to plan ahead.
She’s seen most of mine, but I add the last couple of crackers
and beef strips to the pile. She’s gathered quite a collection of
roots, nuts, greens, and even some berries.
I roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers. You sure this is
safe?
Oh, yes, we have them back home. I’ve been eating them
for days, she says, popping a handful in her mouth. I tentatively
bite into one, and it’s as good as our blackberries. Tak-
203
ing Rue on as an ally seems a better choice all the time. We divide
up our food supplies, so in case we’re separated, we’ll
both be set for a few days. Apart from the food, Rue has a
small water skin, a homemade slingshot, and an extra pair of
socks. She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife. I
know it’s not much, she says as if embarrassed, but I had to
get away from the Cornucopia fast.
You did just right, I say. When I spread out my gear, she
gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses.
How did you get those? she asks.
In my pack. They’ve been useless so far. They don’t block
the sun and they make it harder to see, I say with a shrug.
These aren’t for sun, they’re for darkness, exclaims Rue.
Sometimes, when we harvest through the night, they’ll pass
out a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees. Where the
torchlight doesn’t reach. One time, this boy Martin, he tried to
keep his pair. Hid it in his pants. They killed him on the spot.
They killed a boy for taking these? I say.
Yes, and everyone knew he was no danger. Martin wasn’t
right in the head. I mean, he still acted like a three-year-old.
He just wanted the glasses to play with, says Rue.
Hearing this makes me feel like District 12 is some sort of
safe haven. Of course, people keel over from starvation all the
time, but I can’t imagine the Peacekeepers murdering a simpleminded
child. There’s a little girl, one of Greasy Sae’s
grandkids, who wanders around the Hob. She’s not quite right,
but she’s treated as a sort of pet. People toss her scraps and
things.
204
So what do these do? I ask Rue, taking the glasses.
They let you see in complete darkness, says Rue. Try
them tonight when the sun goes down.
I give Rue some matches and she makes sure I have plenty
of leaves in case my stings flare up again. We extinguish our
fire and head upstream until it’s almost nightfall.
Where do you sleep? I ask her. In the trees? She nods.
In just your jacket?
Rue holds up her extra pair of socks. I have these for my
hands.
I think of how cold the nights have been. You can share my
sleeping bag if you want. We’ll both easily fit. Her face lights
up. I can tell this is more than she dared hope for.
We pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the night just
as the anthem begins to play. There were no deaths today.
Rue, I only woke up today. How many nights did I miss?
The anthem should block out our words, but still I whisper. I
even take the precaution of covering my lips with my hand. I
don’t want the audience to know what I’m planning to tell her
about Peeta. Taking a cue from me, she does the same.
Two, she says. The girls from Districts One and Four are
dead. There’s ten of us left.
Something strange happened. At least, I think it did. It
might have been the tracker jacker venom making me imagine
things, I say. You know the boy from my district? Peeta? I
think he saved my life. But he was with the Careers.
He’s not with them now, she says. I’ve spied on their
base camp by the lake. They made it back before they col-
205
lapsed from the stingers. But he’s not there. Maybe he did save
you and had to run.
I don’t answer. If, in fact, Peeta did save me, I’m in his debt
again. And this can’t be paid back. If he did, it was all probably
just part of his act. You know, to make people think he’s in
love with me.
Oh, says Rue thoughtfully. I didn’t think that was an act.
Course it is, I say. He worked it out with our mentor.
The anthem ends and the sky goes dark. Let’s try out these
glasses. I pull out the glasses and slip them on. Rue wasn’t
kidding. I can see everything from the leaves on the trees to a
skunk strolling through the bushes a good fifty feet away. I
could kill it from here if I had a mind to. I could kill anyone.
I wonder who else got a pair of these, I say.
The Careers have two pairs. But they’ve got everything
down by the lake, Rue says. And they’re so strong.
We’re strong, too, I say. Just in a different way.
You are. You can shoot, she says. What can I do?
You can feed yourself. Can they? I ask.
They don’t need to. They have all those supplies, Rue
says.
Say they didn’t. Say the supplies were gone. How long
would they last? I say. I mean, it’s the Hunger Games, right?
But, Katniss, they’re not hungry, says Rue.
No, they’re not. That’s the problem, I agree. And for the
first time, I have a plan. A plan that isn’t motivated by the
need for flight and evasion. An offensive plan. I think we’re
going to have to fix that, Rue.
206
Rue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly. I know this
because as soon as the anthem finishes she snuggles up
against me and falls asleep. Nor do I have any misgivings
about her, as I take no particular precautions. If she’d wanted
me dead, all she would have had to do was disappear from
that tree without pointing out the tracker jacker nest. Needling
me, at the very back of my mind, is the obvious. Both of us
can’t win these Games. But since the odds are still against either
of us surviving, I manage to ignore the thought.
Besides, I’m distracted by my latest idea about the Careers
and their supplies. Somehow Rue and I must find a way to destroy
their food. I’m pretty sure feeding themselves will be a
tremendous struggle. Traditionally, the Career tributes’ strategy
is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there.
The years when they have not protected it well — one year a
pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it, another a Gamemakers’
flood washed it away — those are usually the years that tributes
from other districts have won. That the Careers have
been better red growing up is actually to their disadvantage,
because they don’t know how to be hungry. Not the way Rue
and I do.
207
But I’m too exhausted to begin any detailed plan tonight.
My wounds recovering, my mind still a bit foggy from the venom,
and the warmth of Rue at my side, her head cradled on
my shoulder, have given me a sense of security. I realize, for
the first time, how very lonely I’ve been in the arena. How
comforting the presence of another human being can be. I give
in to my drowsiness, resolving that tomorrow the tables will
turn. Tomorrow, it’s the Careers who will have to watch their
backs.
The boom of the cannon jolts me awake. The sky’s streaked
with light, the birds already chattering. Rue perches in a
branch across from me, her hands cupping something. We
wait, listening for more shots, but there aren’t any.
Who do you think that was? I can’t help thinking of Peeta.
I don’t know. It could have been any of the others, says
Rue. I guess we’ll know tonight.
Who’s left again? I ask.
The boy from District One. Both tributes from Two. The
boy from Three. Thresh and me. And you and Peeta, says Rue.
That’s eight. Wait, and the boy from Ten, the one with the bad
leg. He makes nine.
There’s someone else, but neither of us can remember who
it is.
I wonder how that last one died, says Rue.
No telling. But it’s good for us. A death should hold the
crowd for a bit. Maybe we’ll have time to do something before
the Gamemakers decide things have been moving too slowly,
I say. What’s in your hands?
208
Breakfast, says Rue. She holds them out revealing two big
eggs.
What kind are those? I ask.
Not sure. There’s a marshy area over that way. Some kind
of waterbird, she says.
It’d be nice to cook them, but neither of us wants to risk a
fire. My guess is the tribute who died today was a victim of the
Careers, which means they’ve recovered enough to be back in
the Games. We each suck out the insides of an egg, eat a rabbit
leg and some berries. It’s a good breakfast anywhere.
Ready to do it? I say, pulling on my pack.
Do what? says Rue, but by the way she bounces up, you
can tell she’s up for whatever I propose.
Today we take out the Careers’ food, I say.
Really? How? You can see the glint of excitement in her
eyes. In this way, she’s exactly the opposite of Prim for whom
adventures are an ordeal.
No idea. Come on, we’ll figure out a plan while we hunt, I
say.
We don’t get much hunting done though because I’m too
busy getting every scrap of information I can out of Rue about
the Careers’ base. She’s only been in to spy on them briefly,
but she’s observant. They have set up their camp beside the
lake. Their supply stash is about thirty yards away. During the
day, they’ve been leaving another tribute, the boy from District
3, to watch over the supplies.
The boy from District Three? I ask. He’s working with
them?
209
Yes, he stays at the camp full-time. He got stung, too, when
they drew the tracker jackers in by the lake, says Rue. I
guess they agreed to let him live if he acted as their guard. But
he’s not very big.
What weapons does he have? I ask.
Not much that I could see. A spear. He might be able to
hold a few of us off with that, but Thresh could kill him easily,
says Rue.
And the food’s just out in the open? I say. She nods.
Something’s not quite right about that whole setup.
I know. But I couldn’t tell what exactly, says Rue. Katniss,
even if you could get to the food, how would you get rid of it?
Burn it. Dump it in the lake. Soak it in fuel. I poke Rue in
the belly, just like I would Prim. Eat it! She giggles. Don’t
worry, I’ll think of something. Destroying things is much easier
than making them.
For a while, we dig roots, we gather berries and greens, we
devise a strategy in hushed voices. And I come to know Rue,
the oldest of six kids, fiercely protective of her siblings, who
gives her rations to the younger ones, who forages in the
meadows in a district where the Peacekeepers are far less obliging
than ours. Rue, who when you ask her what she loves
most in the world, replies, of all things, Music.
Music? I say. In our world, I rank music somewhere between
hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of usefulness. At
least a rainbow gives you a tip about the weather. You have a
lot of time for that?
210
We sing at home. At work, too. That’s why I love your pin,
she says, pointing to the mockingjay that I’ve again forgotten
about.
You have mockingjays? I ask.
Oh, yes. I have a few that are my special friends. We can
sing back and forth for hours. They carry messages for me,
she says.
What do you mean? I say.
I’m usually up highest, so I’m the first to see the flag that
signals quitting time. There’s a special little song I do, says
Rue. She opens her mouth and sings a little four-note run in a
sweet, clear voice. And the mockingjays spread it around the
orchard. That’s how everyone knows to knock off, she continues.
They can be dangerous though, if you get too near
their nests. But you can’t blame them for that.
I unclasp the pin and hold it out to her. Here, you take it. It
has more meaning for you than me.
Oh, no, says Rue, closing my fingers back over the pin. I
like to see it on you. That’s how I decided I could trust you.
Besides, I have this. She pulls a necklace woven out of some
kind of grass from her shirt. On it, hangs a roughly carved
wooden star. Or maybe it’s a flower. It’s a good luck charm.
Well, it’s worked so far, I say, pinning the mockingjay
back on my shirt. Maybe you should just stick with that.
By lunch, we have a plan. By early afternoon, we are poised
to carry it out. I help Rue collect and place the wood for the
first two campfires, the third she’ll have time for on her own.
We decide to meet afterward at the site where we ate our first
211
meal together. The stream should help guide me back to it. Before
I leave, I make sure Rue’s well stocked with food and
matches. I even insist she take my sleeping bag, in case it’s not
possible to rendezvous by nightfall.
What about you? Won’t you be cold? she asks.
Not if I pick up another bag down by the lake, I say. You
know, stealing isn’t illegal here, I say with a grin.
At the last minute, Rue decides to teach me her mockingjay
signal, the one she gives to indicate the day’s work is done. It
might not work. But if you hear the mockingjays singing it,
you’ll know I’m okay, only I can’t get back right away.
Are there many mockingjays here? I ask.
Haven’t you seen them? They’ve got nests everywhere,
she says. I have to admit I haven’t noticed.
Okay, then. If all goes according to plan, I’ll see you for
dinner, I say.
Unexpectedly, Rue throws her arms around me. I only hesitate
a moment before I hug her back.
You be careful, she says to me.
You, too, I say. I turn and head back to the stream, feeling
somehow worried. About Rue being killed, about Rue not being
killed and the two of us being left for last, about leaving
Rue alone, about leaving Prim alone back home. No, Prim has
my mother and Gale and a baker who has promised she won’t
go hungry. Rue has only me.
Once I reach the stream, I have only to follow it downhill to
the place I initially picked it up after the tracker jacker attack.
I have to be cautious as I move along the water though, be-
212
cause I find my thoughts preoccupied with unanswered questions,
most of which concern Peeta. The cannon that fired early
this morning, did that signify his death? If so, how did he
die? At the hand of a Career? And was that in revenge for letting
me live? I struggle again to remember that moment over
Glimmer’s body, when he burst through the trees. But just the
fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that
happened.
I must have been moving very slowly yesterday because I
reach the shallow stretch where I took my bath in just a few
hours. I stop to replenish my water and add a layer of mud to
my backpack. It seems bent on reverting to orange no matter
how many times I cover it.
My proximity to the Careers’ camp sharpens my senses,
and the closer I get to them, the more guarded I am, pausing
frequently to listen for unnatural sounds, an arrow already fitted
into the string of my bow. I don’t see any other tributes,
but I do notice some of the things Rue has mentioned. Patches
of the sweet berries. A bush with the leaves that healed my
stings. Clusters of tracker jacker nests in the vicinity of the
tree I was trapped in. And here and there, the black-and-white
flash of a mockingjay wing in the branches high over my head.
When I reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the foot, I
pause a moment, to gather my courage. Rue has given specific
instructions on how to reach the best spying place near the
lake from this point. Remember, I tell myself. You’re the hunter
now, not them. I get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on. I
make it to the copse Rue has told me about and again have to
213
admire her cleverness. It’s right at the edge of the wood, but
the bushy foliage is so thick down low I can easily observe the
Career camp without being spotted. Between us lies the flat
expanse where the Games began.
There are four tributes. The boy from District 1, Cato and
the girl from District 2, and a scrawny, ashen-skinned boy
who must be from District 3. He made almost no impression
on me at all during our time in the Capitol. I can remember
almost nothing about him, not his costume, not his training
score, not his interview. Even now, as he sits there fiddling
with some kind of plastic box, he’s easily ignored in the presence
of his large and domineering companions. But he must
be of some value or they wouldn’t have bothered to let him
live. Still, seeing him only adds to my sense of unease over
why the Careers would possibly leave him as a guard, why
they have allowed him to live at all.
All four tributes seem to still be recovering from the tracker
jacker attack. Even from here, I can see the large swollen
lumps on their bodies. They must not have had the sense to
remove the stingers, or if they did, not known about the leaves
that healed them. Apparently, whatever medicines they found
in the Cornucopia have been ineffective.
The Cornucopia sits in its original position, but its insides
have been picked clean. Most of the supplies, held in crates,
burlap sacks, and plastic bins, are piled neatly in a pyramid in
what seems a questionable distance from the camp. Others
are sprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid, almost
mimicking the layout of supplies around the Cornucopia at the
214
onset of the Games. A canopy of netting that, aside from discouraging
birds, seems to be useless shelters the pyramid itself.
The whole setup is completely perplexing. The distance, the
netting, and the presence of the boy from District 3. One
thing’s for sure, destroying those supplies is not going to be as
simple as it looks. Some other factor is at play here, and I’d
better stay put until I figure out what it is. My guess is the pyramid
is booby-trapped in some manner. I think of concealed
pits, descending nets, a thread that when broken sends a poisonous
dart into your heart. Really, the possibilities are endless.
While I am mulling over my options, I hear Cato shout out.
He’s pointing up to the woods, far beyond me, and without
turning I know that Rue must have set the first campfire. We’d
made sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke
noticeable. The Careers begin to arm themselves at once.
An argument breaks out. It’s loud enough for me to hear
that it concerns whether or not the boy from District 3 should
stay or accompany them.
He’s coming. We need him in the woods, and his job’s done
here anyway. No one can touch those supplies, says Cato.
What about Lover Boy? says the boy from District 1.
I keep telling you, forget about him. I know where I cut
him. It’s a miracle he hasn’t bled to death yet. At any rate, he’s
in no shape to raid us, says Cato.
So Peeta is out there in the woods, wounded badly. But I am
still in the dark on what motivated him to betray the Careers.
215
Come on, says Cato. He thrusts a spear into the hands of
the boy from District 3, and they head off in the direction of
the fire. The last thing I hear as they enter the woods is Cato
saying, When we find her, I kill her in my own way, and no
one interferes.
Somehow I don’t think he’s talking about Rue. She didn’t
drop a nest of tracker jackers on him.
I stay put for a half an hour or so, trying to figure out what
to do about the supplies. The one advantage I have with the
bow and arrow is distance. I could send a flaming arrow into
the pyramid easily enough — I’m a good enough shot to get it
through those openings in the net — but there’s no guarantee
it would catch. More likely it’d just burn itself out and then
what? I’d have achieved nothing and given them far too much
information about myself. That I was here, that I have an accomplice,
that I can use the bow and arrow with accuracy.
There’s no alternative. I’m going to have to get in closer and
see if I can’t discover what exactly protects the supplies. In
fact, I’m just about to reveal myself when a movement catches
my eye. Several hundred yards to my right, I see someone
emerge from the woods. For a second, I think it’s Rue, but then
I recognize Foxface — she’s the one we couldn’t remember
this morning — creeping out onto the plain. When she decides
it’s safe, she runs for the pyramid, with quick, small steps. Just
before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been littered
around the pyramid, she stops, searches the ground, and
carefully places her feet on a spot. Then she begins to approach
the pyramid with strange little hops, sometimes land-
216
ing on one foot, teetering slightly, sometimes risking a few
steps. At one point, she launches up in the air, over a small
barrel and lands poised on her tiptoes. But she overshot
slightly, and her momentum throws her forward. I hear her
give a sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground, but nothing
happens. In a moment, she’s regained her feet and continues
until she has reached the bulk of the supplies.
So, I’m right about the booby trap, but it’s clearly more
complex than I had imagined. I was right about the girl, too.
How wily is she to have discovered this path into the food and
to be able to replicate it so neatly? She fills her pack, taking a
few items from a variety of containers, crackers from a crate, a
handful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended
from a rope off the side of a bin. But only a handful from each,
not enough to tip off that the food is missing. Not enough to
cause suspicion. And then she’s doing her odd little dance
back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again,
safe and sound.
I realize I’m grinding my teeth in frustration. Foxface has
confirmed what I’d already guessed. But what sort of trap
have they laid that requires such dexterity? Has so many trigger
points? Why did she squeal so as her hands made contact
with the earth? You’d have thought . . . and slowly it begins to
dawn on me . . . you’d have thought the very ground was going
to explode.
It’s mined, I whisper. That explains everything. The Careers’
willingness to leave their supplies, Foxface’s reaction,
the involvement of the boy from District 3, where they have
217
the factories, where they make televisions and automobiles
and explosives. But where did he get them? In the supplies?
That’s not the sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually provide,
given that they like to see the tributes draw blood personally.
I slip out of the bushes and cross to one of the round
metal plates that lifted the tributes into the arena. The ground
around it has been dug up and patted back down. The land
mines were disabled after the sixty seconds we stood on the
plates, but the boy from District 3 must have managed to reactivate
them. I’ve never seen anyone in the Games do that. I bet
it came as a shock even to the Gamemakers.
Well, hurray for the boy from District 3 for putting one over
on them, but what am I supposed to do now? Obviously, I can’t
go strolling into that mess without blowing myself sky-high.
As for sending in a burning arrow, that’s more laughable than
ever. The mines are set off by pressure. It doesn’t have to be a
lot, either. One year, a girl dropped her token, a small wooden
ball, while she was at her plate, and they literally had to
scrape bits of her off the ground.
My arm’s pretty good, I might be able to chuck some rocks
in there and set off what? Maybe one mine? That could start a
chain reaction. Or could it? Would the boy from District 3 have
placed the mines in such a way that a single mine would not
disturb the others? Thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring
the death of the invader. Even if I only blew up one mine,
I’d draw the Careers back down on me for sure. And anyway,
what am I thinking? There’s that net, clearly strung to deflect
any such attack. Besides, what I’d really need is to throw
218
about thirty rocks in there at once, setting off a big chain reaction,
demolishing the whole lot.
I glance back up at the woods. The smoke from Rue’s
second fire is wafting toward the sky. By now, the Careers
have probably begun to suspect some sort of trick. Time is
running out.
There is a solution to this, I know there is, if I can only focus
hard enough. I stare at the pyramid, the bins, the crates, too
heavy to topple over with an arrow. Maybe one contains cooking
oil, and the burning arrow idea is reviving when I realize I
could end up losing all twelve of my arrows and not get a direct
hit on an oil bin, since I’d just be guessing. I’m genuinely
thinking of trying to re-create Foxface’s trip up to the pyramid
in hopes of finding a new means of destruction when my eyes
light on the burlap bag of apples. I could sever the rope in one
shot, didn’t I do as much in the Training Center? It’s a big bag,
but it still might only be good for one explosion. If only I could
free the apples themselves . . .
I know what to do. I move into range and give myself three
arrows to get the job done. I place my feet carefully, block out
the rest of the world as I take meticulous aim, The first arrow
tears through the side of the bag near the top, leaving a split in
the burlap. The second widens it to a gaping hole. I can see the
first apple teetering when I let the third arrow go, catching the
torn flap of burlap and ripping it from the bag.
For a moment, everything seems frozen in time. Then the
apples spill to the ground and I’m blown backward into the
air.
219
The impact with the hard-packed earth of the plain knocks
the wind out of me. My backpack does little to soften the blow.
Fortunately my quiver has caught in the crook of my elbow,
sparing both itself and my shoulder, and my bow is locked in
my grasp. The ground still shakes with explosions. I can’t hear
them. I can’t hear anything at the moment. But the apples
must have set off enough mines, causing debris to activate the
others. I manage to shield my face with my arms as shattered
bits of matter, some of it burning, rain down around me. An
acrid smoke fills the air, which is not the best remedy for
someone trying to regain the ability to breathe.
After about a minute, the ground stops vibrating. I roll on
my side and allow myself a moment of satisfaction the sight of
the smoldering wreckage that was recently the pyramid. The
Careers aren’t likely to salvage anything out of that.
I’d better get out of here, I think. They’ll be making a beeline
for the place. But once I’m on my feet, I realize escape may not
be so simple. I’m dizzy. Not the slightly wobbly kind, but the
kind that sends the trees swooping around you and causes the
earth to move in waves under your feet.
I take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands and
knees. I wait a few minutes to let it pass, but it doesn’t.
220
Panic begins to set in. I can’t stay here. Flight is essential.
But I can neither walk nor hear. I place a hand to my left ear,
the one that was turned toward the blast, and it comes away
bloody. Have I gone deaf from the explosion? The idea frightens
me. I rely as much on my ears as my eyes as a hunter,
maybe more at times. But I can’t let my fear show. Absolutely,
positively, I am live on every screen in Panem.
No blood trails, I tell myself, and manage to pull my hood up
over my head, tie the cord under my chin with uncooperative
fingers. That should help soak up the blood. I can’t walk, but
can I crawl? I move forward tentatively. Yes, if I go very slowly,
I can crawl. Most of the woods will offer insufficient cover.
My only hope is to make it back to Rue’s copse and conceal
myself in greenery. I can’t get caught out here on my hands
and knees in the open. Not only will I face death, it’s sure to be
a long and painful one at Cato’s hand. The thought of Prim
having to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way toward
the hideout.
Another blast knocks me flat on my face. A stray mine, set
off by some collapsing crate. This happens twice more. I’m
reminded of those last few kernels that burst when Prim and I
pop corn over the fire at home.
To say I make it in the nick of time is an understatement. I
have literally just dragged myself into the tangle of hushes at
the base of the trees when there’s Cato, barreling onto the
plain, soon followed by his companions. His rage is so extreme
it might be comical — so people really do tear out their hair
and beat the ground with their fists — if I didn’t know that it
221
was aimed at me, at what I have done to him. Add to that my
proximity, my inability to run or defend myself, and in fact,
the whole thing has me terrified. I’m glad my hiding place
makes it impossible for the cameras to get a close shot of me
because I’m biting my nails like there’s no tomorrow. Gnawing
off the last bits of nail polish, trying to keep my teeth from
chattering.
The boy from District 3 throws stones into the ruins and
must have declared all the mines activated because the Careers
are approaching the wreckage.
Cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and takes
out his anger on the smoking remains by kicking open various
containers. The other tributes are poking around in the mess,
looking for anything to salvage, but there’s nothing. The boy
from District 3 has done his job too well. This idea must occur
to Cato, too, because he turns on the boy and appears to be
shouting at him. The boy from District 3 only has time to turn
and run before Cato catches him in a headlock from behind. I
can see the muscles ripple in Cato’s arms as he sharply jerks
the boy’s head to the side.
It’s that quick. The death of the boy from District 3.
The other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato
down. I can tell he wants to return to the woods, but they keep
pointing at the sky, which puzzles me until I realize, Of course.
They think whoever set off the explosions is dead.
They don’t know about the arrows and the apples. They assume
the booby trap was faulty, but that the tribute who blew
up the supplies was killed doing it. If there was a cannon shot,
222
it could have been easily lost in the subsequent explosions.
The shattered remains of the thief removed by hovercraft.
They retire to the far side of the lake to allow the Gamemakers
to retrieve the body of the boy from District 3. And they wait.
I suppose a cannon goes off. A hovercraft appears and takes
the dead boy. The sun dips below the horizon. Night falls. Up
in the sky, I see the seal and know the anthem must have begun.
A moment of darkness. They show the boy from District
3. They show the boy from District 10, who must have died
this morning. Then the seal reappears. So, now they know.
The bomber survived. In the seal’s light, I can see Cato and the
girl from District 2 put on their night-vision glasses. The boy
from District 1 ignites a tree branch for a torch, illuminating
the grim determination on all their faces. The Careers stride
back into the woods to hunt.
The dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is still
deafened, I can hear a ringing in my right, which seems a good
sign. There’s no point in leaving my hiding place, though. I’m
about as safe as I can be, here at the crime scene. They probably
think the bomber has a two- or three-hour lead on them.
Still it’s a long time before I risk moving.
The first thing I do is dig out my own glasses and put them
on, which relaxes me a little, to have at least one of my hunter’s
senses working. I drink some water and wash the blood
from my ear. Fearing the smell of meat will draw unwanted
predators — fresh blood is bad enough — I make a good meal
out of the greens and roots and berries Rue and I gathered today.
223
Where is my little ally? Did she make it back to the
rendezvous point? Is she worried about me? At least, the sky
has shown we’re both alive.
I run through the surviving tributes on my fingers. The boy
from 1, both from 2, Foxface, both from 11 and 12. Just eight
of us. The betting must be getting really hot in the Capitol.
They’ll be doing special features on each of us now. Probably
interviewing our friends and families. It’s been a long time
since a tribute from District 12 made it into the top eight. And
now there are two of us. Although from what Cato said, Peeta’s
on his way out. Not that Cato is the final word on anything.
Didn’t he just lose his entire stash of supplies?
Let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin, Cato, I think. Let
them begin for real.
A cold breeze has sprung up. I reach for my sleeping bag
before I remember I left it with Rue. I was supposed to pick up
another one, but what with the mines and all, I forgot. I begin
to shiver. Since roosting overnight in a tree isn’t sensible anyway,
I scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover myself
with leaves and pine needles. I’m still freezing. I lay my sheet
of plastic over my upper body and position my backpack to
block the wind. It’s a little better. I begin to have more sympathy
for the girl from District 8 that lit the fire that first night.
But now it’s me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out
until morning. More leaves, more pine needles. I pull my arms
inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my chest. Somehow,
I drift off to sleep.
224
When I open my eyes, the world looks slightly fractured,
and it takes a minute to realize that the sun must be well up
and the glasses fragmenting my vision. As I sit up and remove
them, I hear a laugh somewhere near the lake and freeze. The
laugh’s distorted, but the fact that it registered at all means I
must be regaining my hearing. Yes, my right ear can hear
again, although it’s still ringing. As for my left ear, well, at least
the bleeding has stopped.
I peer through the bushes, afraid the Careers have returned,
trapping me here for an indefinite time. No, it’s Foxface,
standing in the rubble of the pyramid and laughing. She’s
smarter than the Careers, actually finding a few useful items
in the ashes. A metal pot. A knife blade. I’m perplexed by her
amusement until I realize that with the Careers’ stores eliminated,
she might actually stand a chance. Just like the rest of
us. It crosses my mind to reveal myself and enlist her as a
second ally against that pack. But I rule it out. There’s something
about that sly grin that makes me sure that befriending
Foxface would ultimately get me a knife in the back. With that
in mind, this might be an excellent time to shoot her. But she’s
heard something, not me, because her head turns away, toward
the drop-off, and she sprints for the woods. I wait. No
one, nothing shows up. Still, if Foxface thought it was dangerous,
maybe it’s time for me to get out of here, too. Besides, I’m
eager to tell Rue about the pyramid.
Since I’ve no idea where the Careers are, the route back by
the stream seems as good as any. I hurry, loaded bow in one
hand, a hunk of cold groosling in the other, because I’m fa-
225
mished now, and not just for leaves and berries but for the fat
and protein in the meat. The trip to the stream is uneventful.
Once there, I refill my water and wash, taking particular care
with my injured ear. Then I travel uphill using the stream as a
guide. At one point, I find boot prints in the mud along the
bank. The Careers have been here, but not for a while. The
prints are deep because they were made in soft mud, but now
they’re nearly dry in the hot sun. I haven’t been careful
enough about my own tracks, counting on a light tread and the
pine needles to conceal my prints. Now I strip off my boots
and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the stream.
The cool water has an invigorating effect on my body, my
spirits. I shoot two fish, easy pickings in this slow-moving
stream, and go ahead and eat one raw even though I’ve just
had the groosling. The second I’ll save for Rue.
Gradually, subtly, the ringing in my right ear diminishes until
it’s gone entirely. I find myself pawing at my left ear periodically,
trying to clean away whatever deadens its ability to collect
sounds. If there’s improvement, it’s undetectable. I can’t
adjust to deafness in the ear. It makes me feel off-balanced
and defenseless to my left. Blind even. My head keeps turning
to the injured side, as my right ear tries to compensate for the
wall of nothingness where yesterday there was a constant
flow of information. The more time that passes, the less hopeful
I am that this is an injury that will heal.
When I reach the site of our first meeting, I feel certain it’s
been undisturbed. There’s no sign of Rue, not on the ground
or in the trees. This is odd. By now she should have returned,

as it’s midday. Undoubtedly, she spent the night in a tree
somewhere. What else could she do with no light and the Careers
with their night-vision glasses tramping around the
woods. And the third fire she was supposed to set — although
I forgot to check for it last night — was the farthest from our
site of all. She’s probably just being cautious about making her
way back. I wish she’d hurry, because I don’t want to hang
around here too long. I want to spend the afternoon traveling
to higher ground, hunting as we go. But there’s nothing really
for me to do but wait.
I wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean my ever-growing
list of wounds. The burns are much better but I
use a bit of medicine on them anyway. The main thing to worry
about now is keeping out infection. I go ahead and eat the
second fish. It isn’t going to last long in this hot sun, but it
should be easy enough to spear a few more for Rue. If she
would just show up.
Feeling too vulnerable on the ground with my lopsided
hearing, I scale a tree to wait. If the Careers show up, this will
be a fine place to shoot them from. The sun moves slowly. I do
things to pass the time. Chew leaves and apply them to my
stings that are deflated but still tender. Comb through my
damp hair with my fingers and braid it. Lace my boots back
up. Check over my bow and remaining nine arrows. Test my
left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf near it, but
without good results.
Despite the groosling and the fish, my stomach’s growling,
and I know I’m going to have what we call a hollow day back
227
in District 12. That’s a day where no matter what you put in
your belly, it’s never enough. Having nothing to do but sit in a
tree makes it worse, so I decide to give into it. After all, I’ve
lost a lot of weight in the arena, I need some extra calories.
And having the bow and arrows makes me far more confident
about my future prospects.
I slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts. My last cracker. The
groosling neck. That’s good because it takes time to pick clean.
Finally, a groosling wing and the bird is history. But it’s a hollow
day, and even with all that I start daydreaming about
food. Particularly the decadent dishes served in the Capitol.
The chicken in creamy orange sauce. The cakes and pudding.
Bread with butter. Noodles in green sauce. The lamb and dried
plum stew. I suck on a few mint leaves and tell myself to get
over it. Mint is good because we drink mint tea after supper
often, so it tricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over.
Sort of.
Dangling up in the tree, with the sun warming me, a mouthful
of mint, my bow and arrows at hand . . . this is the most relaxed
I’ve been since I’ve entered the arena. If only Rue would
show up, and we could clear out. As the shadows grow, so
does my restlessness. By late afternoon, I’ve resolved to go
looking for her. I can at least visit the spot where she set the
third fire and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts.
Before I go, I scatter a few mint leaves around our old
campfire. Since we gathered these some distance away, Rue
will understand I’ve been here, while they’ll mean nothing to
the Careers.
228
In less than an hour, I’m at the place where we agreed to
have the third fire and I know something has gone amiss. The
wood has been neatly arranged, expertly interspersed with
tinder, but it has never been lit. Rue set up the fire but never
made it back here. Somewhere between the second column of
smoke I spied before I blew up the supplies and this point, she
ran into trouble.
I have to remind myself she’s still alive. Or is she? Could the
cannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee
hours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken
to pick it up? Will she appear in the sky tonight? No, I refuse to
believe it. There could be a hundred other explanations. She
could have lost her way. Run into a pack of predators or
another tribute, like Thresh, and had to hide. Whatever happened,
I’m almost certain she’s stuck out there, somewhere
between the second fire and the unlit one at my feet. Something
is keeping her up a tree.
I think I’ll go hunt it down.
It’s a relief to be doing something after sitting around all afternoon.
I creep silently through the shadows, letting them
conceal me. But nothing seems suspicious. There’s no sign of
any kind of struggle, no disruption of the needles on the
ground. I’ve stopped for just a moment when I hear it. I have
to cock my head around to the side to be sure, but there it is
again. Rue’s four-note tune coming out of a mockingjay’s
mouth. The one that means she’s all right.
I grin and move in the direction of the bird. Another just a
short distance ahead, picks up on the handful of notes. Rue
229
has been singing to them, and recently. Otherwise they’d have
taken up some other song. My eyes lift up into the trees,
searching for a sign of her. I swallow and sing softly back, hoping
she’ll know it’s safe to join me. A mockingjay repeats the
melody to me. And that’s when I hear the scream.
It’s a child’s scream, a young girl’s scream, there’s no one in
the arena capable of making that sound except Rue. And now
I’m running, knowing this may be a trap, knowing the three
Careers may be poised to attack me, but I can’t help myself.
There’s another high-pitched cry, this time my name. Katniss!
Katniss!
Rue! I shout back, so she knows I’m near. So, they know
I’m near, and hopefully the girl who has attacked them with
tracker jackers and gotten an eleven they still can’t explain
will be enough to pull their attention away from her. Rue! I’m
coming!
When I break into the clearing, she’s on the ground, hopelessly
entangled in a net. She just has time to reach her hand
through the mesh and say my name before the spear enters
her body.
230
The boy from District 1 dies before he can pull out the
spear. My arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck. He
falls to his knees and halves the brief remainder of his life by
yanking out the arrow and drowning in his own blood. I’m reloaded,
shifting my aim from side to side, while I shout at Rue,
Are there more? Are there more?
She has to say no several times before I hear it. Rue has
rolled to her side, her body curved in and around the spear. I
shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife, freeing
her from the net. One look at the wound and I know it’s far
beyond my capacity to heal, beyond anyone’s probably. The
spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach. I crouch
before her, staring helplessly at the embedded weapon.
There’s no point in comforting words, in telling her she’ll be
all right. She’s no fool. Her hand reaches out and I clutch it like
a lifeline. As if it’s me who’s dying instead of Rue.
You blew up the food? she whispers.
Every last bit, I say.
You have to win, she says.
I’m going to. Going to win for both of us now, I promise. I
hear a cannon and look up. It must be for the boy from District
1.
231
Don’t go. Rue tightens her grip on my hand.
Course not. Staying right here, I say. I move in closer to
her, pulling her head onto my lap. I gently brush the dark,
thick hair back behind her ear.
Sing, she says, but I barely catch the word.
Sing? I think. Sing what? I do know a few songs. Believe it or
not, there was once music in my house, too. Music I helped
make. My father pulled me in with that remarkable voice —
but I haven’t sung much since he died. Except when Prim is
very sick. Then I sing her the same songs she liked as a baby.
Sing. My throat is tight with tears, hoarse from smoke and
fatigue. But if this is Prim’s, I mean, Rue’s last request, I have
to at least try. The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby,
one we sing fretful, hungry babies to sleep with, It’s old, very
old I think. Made up long ago in our hills. What my music
teacher calls a mountain air. But the words are easy and
soothing, promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this
awful piece of time we call today.
I give a small cough, swallow hard, and begin:
Deep in the meadow, under the willow
A bed of grass, a soft green pillow
Lay down your head, and close your sleepy eyes
And when again they open, the sun will rise.
Here it’s safe, here it’s warm
Here the daisies guard you from every harm
232
Here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them
true
Here is the place where I love you.
Rue’s eyes have fluttered shut. Her chest moves but only
slightly. My throat releases the tears and they slide down my
cheeks. But I have to finish the song for her.
Deep in the meadow, hidden far away
A cloak of leaves, a moonbeam ray
Forget your woes and let your troubles lay
And when again it’s morning, they’ll wash away.
Here it’s safe, here it’s warm
Here the daisies guard you from every harm
The final lines are barely audible.
Here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them
true
Here is the place where I love you.
Everything’s still and quiet. Then, almost eerily, the mockingjays
take up my song.
For a moment, I sit there, watching my tears drip down on
her face. Rue’s cannon fires. I lean forward and press my lips
against her temple. Slowly, as if not to wake her, I lay her head
back on the ground and release her hand.
233
They’ll want me to clear out now. So they can collect the
bodies. And there’s nothing to stay for. I roll the boy from District
1 onto his face and take his pack, retrieve the arrow that
ended his life. I cut Rue’s pack from her back as well, knowing
she’d want me to have it but leave the spear in her stomach.
Weapons in bodies will be transported to the hovercraft. I’ve
no use for a spear, so the sooner it’s gone from the arena the
better.
I can’t stop looking at Rue, smaller than ever, a baby animal
curled up in a nest of netting. I can’t bring myself to leave her
like this. Past harm, but seeming utterly defenseless. To hate
the boy from District 1, who also appears so vulnerable in
death, seems inadequate. It’s the Capitol I hate, for doing this
to all of us.
Gale’s voice is in my head. His ravings against the Capitol
no longer pointless, no longer to be ignored. Rue’s death has
forced me to confront my own fury against the cruelty, the injustice
they inflict upon us. But here, even more strongly than
at home, I feel my impotence. There’s no way to take revenge
on the Capitol. Is there?
Then I remember Peeta’s words on the roof. Only I keep
wishing I could think of a way to . . . to show the Capital they
don’t own me. That I’m more than just a piece in their Games.
And for the first time, I understand what he means.
I want to do something, right here, right now, to shame
them, to make them accountable, to show the Capitol that
whatever they do or force us to do there is a part of every tri-
234
bute they can’t own. That Rue was more than a piece in their
Games. And so am I.
A few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers.
Perhaps they are really weeds of some sort, but they have
blossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white. I
gather up an armful and come back to Rue’s side. Slowly, one
stem at a time, I decorate her body in the flowers. Covering
the ugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair with
bright colors.
They’ll have to show it. Or, even if they choose to turn the
cameras elsewhere at this moment, they’ll have to bring them
back when they collect the bodies and everyone will see her
then and know I did it. I step back and take a last look at Rue.
She could really be asleep in that meadow after all.
Bye, Rue, I whisper. I press the three middle fingers of my
left hand against my lips and hold them out in her direction.
Then I walk away without looking back.
The birds fall silent. Somewhere, a mockingjay gives the
warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft. I don’t know
how it knows. It must hear things that humans can’t. I pause,
my eyes focused on what’s ahead, not what’s happening behind
me. It doesn’t take long, then the general birdsong begins
again and I know she’s gone.
Another mockingjay, a young one by the look of it, lands on
a branch before me and bursts out Rue’s melody.
My song, the hovercraft, were too unfamiliar for this novice
to pick up, but it has mastered her handful of notes. The ones
that mean she’s safe.
235
Good and safe, I say as I pass under its branch. We don’t
have to worry about her now. Good and safe.
I’ve no idea where to go. The brief sense of home I had that
one night with Rue has vanished. My feet wander this way and
that until sunset. I’m not afraid, not even watchful. Which
makes me an easy target. Except I’d kill anyone I met on sight.
Without emotion or the slightest tremor in my hands. My hatred
of the Capitol has not lessened my hatred of my competitors
in the least. Especially the Careers. They, at least, can be
made to pay for Rue’s death.
No one materializes though. There aren’t many of us left
and it’s a big arena. Soon they’ll be pulling out some other device
to force us together. But there’s been enough gore today.
Perhaps we’ll even get to sleep.
I’m about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp when
a silver parachute floats down and lands in front of me. A gift
from a sponsor. But why now? I’ve been in fairly good shape
with supplies. Maybe Haymitch’s noticed my despondency
and is trying to cheer me up a bit. Or could it be something to
help my ear?
I open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread It’s not
the fine white Capitol stuff. It’s made of dark ration grain and
shaped in a crescent. Sprinkled with seeds. I flash back to Peeta’s
lesson on the various district breads in the Training Center.
This bread came from District 11. I cautiously lift the still
warm loaf. What must it have cost the people of District 11
who can’t even feed themselves? How many would’ve had to
do without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this
236
one loaf? It had been meant for Rue, surely. But instead of
pulling the gift when she died, they’d authorized Haymitch to
give it to me. As a thank-you? Or because, like me, they don’t
like to let debts go unpaid? For whatever reason, this is a first.
A district gift to a tribute who’s not your own.
I lift my face and step into the last falling rays of sunlight.
My thanks to the people of District Eleven, I say. I want them
to know I know where it came from. That the full value of
their gift has been recognized.
I climb dangerously high into a tree, not for safety but to
get as far away from today as I can. My sleeping bag is rolled
neatly in Rue’s pack. Tomorrow I’ll sort through the supplies.
Tomorrow I’ll make a new plan. But tonight, all I can do is
strap myself in and take tiny bites of the bread. It’s good. It
tastes of home.
Soon the seal’s in the sky, the anthem plays in my right ear.
I see the boy from District 1, Rue. That’s all for tonight. Six of
us left, I think. Only six. With the bread still locked in my
hands, I fall asleep at once.
Sometimes when things are particularly bad, my brain will
give me a happy dream. A visit with my father in the woods.
An hour of sunlight and cake with Prim. Tonight it sends me
Rue, still decked in her flowers, perched in a high sea of trees,
trying to teach me to talk to the mockingjays. I see no sign of
her wounds, no blood, just a bright, laughing girl. She sings
songs I’ve never heard in a clear, melodic voice. On and on.
Through the night. There’s a drowsy in-between period when
I can hear the last few strains of her music although she’s lost
237
in the leaves. When I fully awaken, I’m momentarily comforted.
I try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream, but
it quickly slips away, leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever.
Heaviness infuses my whole body, as if there’s liquid lead in
my veins. I’ve lost the will to do the simplest tasks, to do anything
but lie here, staring unblinkingly through the canopy of
leaves. For several hours, I remain motionless. As usual, it’s
the thought of Prim’s anxious face as she watches me on the
screens back home that breaks me from my lethargy.
I give myself a series of simple commands to follow, like
Now you have to sit up, Katniss. Now you have to drink water,
Katniss. I act on the orders with slow, robotic motions.
Now you have to sort the packs, Katniss.
Rue’s pack holds my sleeping bag, her nearly empty water
skin, a handful of nuts and roots, a bit of rabbit, her extra
socks, and her slingshot. The boy from District 1 has several
knives, two spare spearheads, a flashlight, a small leather
pouch, a first-aid kit, a full bottle of water, and a pack of dried
fruit. A pack of dried fruit! Out of all he might have chosen
from. To me, this is a sign of extreme arrogance. Why bother
to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp?
When you will kill your enemies so quickly you’ll be home before
you’re hungry? I can only hope the other Careers traveled
so lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with
nothing.
Speaking of which, my own supply is running low. I finish
off the loaf from District 11 and the last of the rabbit. How
238
quickly the food disappears. All I have left are Rue’s roots and
nuts, the boy’s dried fruit, and one strip of beef. Now you have
to hunt, Katniss, I tell myself.
I obediently consolidate the supplies I want into my pack.
After I climb down the tree, I conceal the boy’s knives and
spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no one else can use them.
I’ve lost my bearings what with all the wandering around I did
yesterday evening, but I try and head back in the general direction
of the stream. I know I’m on course when I come
across Rue’s third, unlit fire. Shortly thereafter, I discover a
flock of grooslings perched in the trees and take out three before
they know what hit them. I return to Rue’s signal fire and
start it up, not caring about the excessive smoke. Where are
you, Cato? I think as I roast the birds and Rue’s roots. I’m waiting
right here.
Who knows where the Careers are now? Either too far to
reach me or too sure this is a trick or ... is it possible? Too
scared of me? They know I have the bow and arrows, of
course, Cato saw me take them from Glimmer’s body, but have
they put two and two together yet? Figured out I blew up the
supplies and killed their fellow Career? Possibly they think
Thresh did this. Wouldn’t he be more likely to revenge Rue’s
death than I would? Being from the same district? Not that he
ever took any interest in her.
And what about Foxface? Did she hang around to watch me
blow up the supplies? No. When I caught her laughing in the
ashes the next morning, it was as if someone had given her a
lovely surprise.
239
I doubt they think Peeta has lit this signal fire. Cato’s sure
he’s as good as dead. I find myself wishing I could tell Peeta
about the flowers I put on Rue. That I now understand what
he was trying to say on the roof. Perhaps if he wins the Games,
he’ll see me on victor’s night, when they replay the highlights
of the Games on a screen over the stage where we did our interviews.
The winner sits in a place of honor on the platform,
surrounded by their support crew.
But I told Rue I’d be there. For both of us. And somehow
that seems even more important than the vow I gave Prim.
I really think I stand a chance of doing it now. Winning. It’s
not just having the arrows or outsmarting the Careers a few
times, although those things help. Something happened when
I was holding Rue’s hand, watching the life drain out of her.
Now I am determined to revenge her, to make her loss unforgettable,
and I can only do that by winning and thereby making
myself unforgettable.
I overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to shoot,
but no one does. Maybe the other tributes are out there beating
one another senseless. Which would be fine, Ever since the
bloodbath, I’ve been featured on screens most than I care.
Eventually, I wrap up my food and go back to the stream to
replenish my water and gather some. But the heaviness from
the morning drapes back over me and even though it’s only
early evening, I climb a tree and settle in for the night. My
brain begins to replay the events from yesterday. I keep seeing
Rue speared, my arrow piercing the boy’s neck. I don’t
know why I should even care about the boy.
240
Then I realize . . . he was my first kill.
Along with other statistics they report to help people place
their bets, every tribute has a list of kills. I guess technically
I’d get credited for Glimmer and the girl from District 4, too,
for dumping that nest on them. But the boy from District 1
was the first person I knew would die because of my actions.
Numerous animals have lost their lives at my hands, but only
one human. I hear Gale saying, How different can it be, really?
Amazingly similar in the execution. A bow pulled, an arrow
shot. Entirely different in the aftermath. I killed a boy whose
name I don’t even know. Somewhere his family is weeping for
him. His friends call for my blood. Maybe he had a girlfriend
who really believed he would come back . . .
But then I think of Rue’s still body and I’m able to banish
the boy from my mind. At least, for now.
It’s been an uneventful day according to the sky. No deaths.
I wonder how long we’ll get until the next catastrophe drives
us back together. If it’s going to be tonight, I want to get some
sleep first. I cover my good ear to block out the strains of the
anthem, but then I hear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation.
For the most part, the only communication the tributes get
from outside the arena is the nightly death toll. But occasionally,
there will be trumpets followed by an announcement.
Usually, this will be a call to a feast. When food is scarce, the
Gamemakers will invite the players to a banquet, somewhere
known to all like the Cornucopia, as an inducement to gather
241
and fight. Sometimes there is a feast and sometimes there’s
nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete
for. I wouldn’t go in for the food, but this could be an ideal
time to take out a few competitors.
Claudius Templesmith’s voice booms down from overhead,
congratulating the six of us who remain. But he is not inviting
us to a feast. He’s saying something very confusing. There’s
been a rule change in the Games. A rule change! That in itself
is mind bending since we don’t really have any rules to speak
of except don’t step off your circle for sixty seconds and the
unspoken rule about not eating one another. Under the new
rule, both tributes from the same district will be declared
winners if they are the last two alive. Claudius pauses, as if he
knows we’re not getting it, and repeats the change again.
The news sinks in. Two tributes can win this year. If they’re
from the same district. Both can live. Both of us can live.
Before I can stop myself, I call out Peeta’s name.
242
PART III
"THE VICTOR"
243
I clap my hands over my mouth, but the sound has already
escaped. The sky goes black and I hear a chorus of frogs begin
to sing. Stupid! I tell myself. What a stupid thing to do! I wait,
frozen, for the woods to come alive with assailants. Then I remember
there’s almost no one left.
Peeta, who’s been wounded, is now my ally. Whatever
doubts I’ve had about him dissipate because if either of us
took the other’s life now we’d be pariahs when we returned to
District 12. In fact, I know if I was watching I’d loathe any tribute
who didn’t immediately ally with their district partner.
Besides, it just makes sense to protect each other. And in my
case — being one of the star-crossed lovers from District 12
— it’s an absolute requirement if I want any more help from
sympathetic sponsors.
The star-crossed lovers . . . Peeta must have been playing
that angle all along. Why else would the Gamemakers have
made this unprecedented change in the rules? For two tributes
to have a shot at winning, our romance must be so
popular with the audience that condemning it would jeopardize
the success of the Games. No thanks to me. All I’ve done is
managed not to kill Peeta. But whatever he’s done in the arena,
he must have the audience convinced it was to keep me
244
alive. Shaking his head to keep me from running to the Cornucopia.
Fighting Cato to let me escape. Even hooking up with
the Careers must have been a move to protect me. Peeta, it
turns out, has never been a danger to me.
The thought makes me smile. I drop my hands and hold my
face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it.
So, who is there left to be afraid of? Foxface? The boy tribute
from her district is dead. She’s operating alone, at night.
And her strategy has been to evade, not attack. I don’t really
think that, even if she heard my voice, she’d do anything but
hope someone else would kill me.
Then there’s Thresh. All right, he’s a distinct threat. But I
haven’t seen him, not once, since the Games began. I think
about how Foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at
the site of the explosion. But she didn’t turn to the Woods, she
turned to whatever lies across from it. To that area of the arena
that drops off into I don’t know what. I feel almost certain
that the person she ran from was Thresh and that is his domain.
He’d never have heard me from there and, even if he
did, I’m up too high for someone his size to reach.
So that leaves Cato and the girl from District 2, who are
now surely celebrating the new rule. They’re the only ones left
who benefit from it besides Peeta and myself. Do I run from
them now, on the chance they heard me call Peeta’s name? No,
I think. Let them come. Let them come with their night-vision
glasses and their heavy, branch-breaking bodies.
Right into the range of my arrows. But I know they won’t. If
they didn’t come in daylight to my fire, they won’t risk what
245
could be another trap at night. When they come, it will be on
their own terms, not because I’ve let them know my whereabouts.
Stay put and get some sleep, Katniss, I instruct myself, although
I wish I could start tracking Peeta now. Tomorrow,
you’ll find him.
I do sleep, but in the morning I’m extra-cautious, thinking
that while the Careers might hesitate to attack me in a tree,
they’re completely capable of setting an ambush for me. I
make sure to fully prepare myself for the day — eating a big
breakfast, securing my pack, readying my weapons — before I
descend. But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on the
ground.
Today I’ll have to be scrupulously careful. The Careers will
know I’m trying to locate Peeta. They may well want to wait
until I do before they move in. If he’s as badly wounded as Cato
thinks, I’d be in the position of having to defend us both
without any assistance. But if he’s that incapacitated, how has
he managed to stay alive? And how on earth will I find him?
I try to think of anything Peeta ever said that might give me
an indication as to where he’s hiding out, but nothing rings a
bell. So I go back to the last moment I saw him sparkling in the
sunlight, yelling at me to run. Then Cato appeared, his sword
drawn. And after I was gone, he wounded Peeta. But how did
Peeta get away? Maybe he’d held out better against the tracker
jacker poison than Cato.
Maybe that was the variable that allowed him to escape.
But he’d been stung, too. So how far could he have gotten,
246
stabbed and filled with venom? And how has he stayed alive
all these days since? If the wound and the stingers haven’t
killed him, surely thirst would have taken him by now.
And that’s when I get my first clue to his whereabouts. He
couldn’t have survived without water. I know that from my
first few days here. He must be hidden somewhere near a
source. There’s the lake, but I find that an unlikely option
since it’s so close to the Careers’ base camp. A few spring-fed
pools. But you’d really be a sitting duck at one of those. And
the stream. The one that leads from the camp Rue and I made
all the way down near the lake and beyond. If he stuck to the
stream, he could change his location and always be near water.
He could walk in the current and erase any tracks. He
might even be able to get a fish or two.
Well, it’s a place to start, anyway.
To confuse my enemies’ minds, I start a fire with plenty of
green wood. Even if they think it’s a ruse, I hope they’ll decide
I’m hidden somewhere near it. While in reality, I’ll be tracking
Peeta.
The sun burns off the morning haze almost immediately
and I can tell the day will be hotter than usual. The waters
cool and pleasant on my bare feet as I head downstream. I’m
tempted to call out Peeta’s name as I go but decide against it. I
will have to find him with my eyes and one good ear or he will
have to find me. But he’ll know I’ll be looking, right? He won’t
have so low of an opinion of me as to think I’d ignore the new
rule and keep to myself. Would he? He’s very hard to predict,
247
which might be interesting under different circumstances, but
at the moment only provides an extra obstacle.
It doesn’t take long to reach the spot where I peeled off to
go the Careers’ camp. There’s been no sign of Peeta, but this
doesn’t surprise me. I’ve been up and down this stretch three
times since the tracker jacker incident. If he were nearby,
surely I’d have had some suspicion of it. The stream begins to
curve to the left into a part of the woods that’s new to me.
Muddy banks covered in tangled water plants lead to large
rocks that increase in size until I begin to feel somewhat
trapped. It would be no small matter to escape the stream
now. Fighting off Cato or Thresh as I climbed over this rocky
terrain. In fact, I’ve just about decided I’m on the wrong track
entirely, that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate getting
to and from this water source, when I see the bloody
streak going down the curve of a boulder. It’s long dried now,
but the smeary lines running side to side suggest someone —
who perhaps was not fully in control of his mental faculties —
tried to wipe it away.
Hugging the rocks, I move slowly in the direction of the
blood, searching for him. I find a few more bloodstains, one
with a few threads of fabric glued to it, but no sign of life. I
break down and say his name in a hushed voice. Peeta! Peeta!
Then a mockingjay lands on a scruffy tree and begins to
mimic my tones so I stop. I give up and climb back down to the
stream thinking, He must have moved on. Somewhere farther
down.
248
My foot has just broken the surface of the water when I
hear a voice.
You here to finish me off, sweetheart?
I whip around. It’s come from the left, so I can’t pick it up
very well. And the voice was hoarse and weak. Still, it must
have been Peeta. Who else in the arena would call me sweetheart?
My eyes peruse the bank, but there’s nothing. Just
mud, the plants, the base of the rocks.
Peeta? I whisper. Where are you? There’s no answer.
Could I just have imagined it? No, I’m certain it was real and
very close at hand, too. Peeta? I creep along the bank.
Well, don’t step on me.
I jump back. His voice was right under my feet. Still there’s
nothing. Then his eyes open, unmistakably blue in the brown
mud and green leaves. I gasp and am rewarded with a hint of
white teeth as he laughs.
It’s the final word in camouflage. Forget chucking weights
around. Peeta should have gone into his private session with
the Gamemakers and painted himself into a tree. Or a boulder.
Or a muddy bank full of weeds.
Close your eyes again, I order. He does, and his mouth,
too, and completely disappears. Most of what I judge to be his
body is actually under a layer of mud and plants. His face and
arms are so artfully disguised as to be invisible. I kneel beside
him. I guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off.
Peeta smiles. Yes, frosting. The final defense of the dying.
249
You’re not going to die, I tell him firmly. Says who? His
voice is so ragged. Says me. We’re on the same team now, you
know, I tell him.
His eyes open. So, I heard. Nice of you to find what’s left of
me.
I pull out my water bottle and give him a drink. Did Cato
cut you? I ask.
Left leg. Up high, he answers.
Let’s get you in the stream, wash you off so I can see what
kind of wounds you’ve got, I say.
Lean down a minute first, he says. Need to tell you something.
I lean over and put my good ear to his lips, which tickle
as he whispers. Remember, we’re madly in love, so it’s all
right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.
I jerk my head back but end up laughing. Thanks, I’ll keep
it in mind. At least, he’s still able to joke around. But when I
start to help him to the stream, all the levity disappears. It’s
only two feet away, how hard can it be? Very hard when I realize
he’s unable to move an inch on his own. He’s so weak that
the best he can do is not to resist. I try to drag him, but despite
the fact that I know he’s doing all he can to keep quiet, sharp
cries of pain escape him. The mud and plants seem to have
imprisoned him and I finally have to give a gigantic tug to
break him from their clutches. He’s still two feet from the water,
lying there, teeth gritted, tears cutting trails in the dirt on
his face.
Look, Peeta, I’m going to roll you into the stream. It’s very
shallow here, okay? I say.
250
Excellent, he says.
I crouch down beside him. No matter what happens, I tell
myself, don’t stop until he’s in the water. On three, I say.
One, two, three! I can only manage one full roll before I have
to stop because of the horrible sound he’s making. Now he’s
on the edge of the stream. Maybe this is better anyway.
Okay, change of plans. I’m not going to put you all the way
in, I tell him. Besides, if I get him in, who knows if I’d ever be
able to get him out?
No more rolling? he asks.
That’s all done. Let’s get you cleaned up. Keep an eye on
the woods for me, okay? I say. It’s hard to know where to
start. He so caked with mud and matted leaves, I can’t even
see his clothes. If he’s wearing clothes. The thought makes me
hesitate a moment, but then I plunge in. Naked bodies are no
big deal in the arena, right?
I’ve got two water bottles and Rue’s water skin. I prop them
against rocks in the stream so that two are always filling while
I pour the third over Peeta’s body. It takes a while, but I finally
get rid of enough mud to find his clothes. I gently unzip his
jacket, unbutton his shirt and ease them off him. His undershirt
is so plastered into his wounds I have to cut it away with
my knife and drench him again to work it loose. He’s badly
bruised with a long burn across his chest and four tracker
jacker stings, if you count the one under his ear. But I feel a bit
better. This much I can fix. I decide to take care of his upper
body first, to alleviate some pain, before I tackle whatever
damage Cato did to his leg.
251
Since treating his wounds seems pointless when he’s lying
in what’s become a mud puddle, I manage to prop him up
against a boulder. He sits there, uncomplaining, while I wash
away all the traces of dirt from his hair and skin. His flesh is
very pale in the sunlight and he no longer looks strong and
stocky. I have to dig the stingers out of his tracker jacker
lumps, which causes him to wince, but the minute I apply the
leaves he sighs in relief. While he dries in the sun, I wash his
filthy shirt and jacket and spread them over boulders. Then I
apply the burn cream to his chest. This is when I notice how
hot his skin is becoming. The layer of mud and the bottles of
water have disguised the fact that he’s burning with fever. I
dig through the first-aid kit I got from the boy from District 1
and find pills that reduce your temperature. My mother actually
breaks down and buys these on occasion when her
home remedies fail.
Swallow these, I tell him, and he obediently takes the
medicine. You must be hungry.
Not really. It’s funny, I haven’t been hungry for days, says
Peeta. In fact, when I offer him groosling, he wrinkles his nose
at it and turns away. That’s when I know how sick he is.
Peeta, we need to get some food in you, I insist.
It’ll just come right back up, he says. The best I can do is
to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple. Thanks. I’m much
better, really. Can I sleep now, Katniss? he asks.
Soon, I promise. I need to look at your leg first. Trying to
be as gentle as I can, I remove his boots, his socks, and then
very slowly inch his pants off of him. I can see the tear Cato’s
252
sword made in the fabric over his thigh, but it in no way prepares
me for what lies underneath. The deep inflamed gash
oozing both blood and pus. The swelling of the leg. And worst
of all, the smell of festering flesh.
I want to run away. Disappear into the woods like I did that
day they brought the burn victim to our house. Go and hunt
while my mother and Prim attend to what I have neither the
skill nor the courage to face. But there’s no one here but me. I
try to capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes when
handling particularly bad cases.
Pretty awful, huh? says Peeta. He’s watching me closely.
So-so. I shrug like it’s no big deal. You should see some of
the people they bring my mother from the mines. I refrain
from saying how I usually clear out of the house whenever
she’s treating anything worse than a cold. Come to think of it, I
don’t even much like to be around coughing. First thing is to
clean it well.
I’ve left on Peeta’s undershorts because they’re not in bad
shape and I don’t want to pull them over the swollen thigh
and, all right, maybe the idea of him being naked makes me
uncomfortable. That’s another thing about my mother and
Prim. Nakedness has no effect on them, gives them no cause
for embarrassment. Ironically, at this point in the Games, my
little sister would be of far more use to Peeta than I am. I scoot
my square of plastic under him so I can wash down the rest of
him. With each bottle I pour over him, the worse the wound
looks. The rest of his lower body has fared pretty well, just
one tracker jacker sting and a few small burns that I treat
253
quickly. But the gash on his leg . . . what on earth can I do for
that?
Why don’t we give it some air and then . . . I trail off.
And then you’ll patch it up? says Peeta. He looks almost
sorry for me, as if he knows how lost I am.
That’s right, I say. In the meantime, you eat these. I put
a few dried pear halves in his hand and go back in the stream
to wash the rest of his clothes. When they’re flattened out and
drying, I examine the contents of the first-aid kit. It’s pretty
basic stuff. Bandages, fever pills, medicine to calm stomachs.
Nothing of the caliber I’ll need to treat Peeta.
We’re going to have to experiment some, I admit. I know
the tracker jacker leaves draw out infection, so I start with
those. Within minutes of pressing the handful of chewed-up
green stuff into the wound, pus begins running down the side
of his leg. I tell myself this is a good thing and bite the inside of
my cheek hard because my breakfast is threatening to make a
reappearance.
Katniss? Peeta says. I meet his eyes, knowing my face
must be some shade of green. He mouths the words. How
about that kiss?
I burst out laughing because the whole thing is so revolting
I can’t stand it.
Something wrong? he asks a little too innocently.
I . . . I’m no good at this. I’m not my mother. I’ve no idea
what I’m doing and I hate pus, I say. Euh! I allow myself to
let out a groan as I rinse away the first round of leaves and
apply the second. Euuuh!
254
How do you hunt? he asks.
Trust me. Killing things is much easier than this, I say. Although
for all I know, I am killing you.
Can you speed it up a little? he asks.
No. Shut up and eat your pears, I say.
After three applications and what seems like a bucket of
pus, the wound does look better. Now that the swelling has
gone down, I can see how deep Cato’s sword cut. Right down
to the bone.
What next, Dr. Everdeen? he asks.
Maybe I’ll put some of the burn ointment on it. I think it
helps with infection anyway. And wrap it up? I say. I do and
the whole thing seems a lot more manageable, covered in
clean white cotton. Although, against the sterile bandage, the
hem of his undershorts looks filthy and teeming with contagion.
I pull out Rue’s backpack. Here, cover yourself with this
and I’ll wash your shorts.
Oh, I don’t care if you see me, says Peeta.
You’re just like the rest of my family, I say. I care, all
right? I turn my back and look at the stream until the undershorts
splash into the current. He must be feeling a bit better
if he can throw.
You know, you’re kind of squeamish for such a lethal person,
says Peeta as I beat the shorts clean between two rocks.
I wish I’d let you give Haymitch a shower after all.
I wrinkle my nose at the memory. What’s he sent you so
far?
255
Not a thing, says Peeta. Then there’s a pause as it hits him.
Why, did you get something?
Burn medicine, I say almost sheepishly. Oh, and some
bread.
I always knew you were his favorite, says Peeta.
Please, he can’t stand being in the same room with me, I
say.
Because you’re just alike, mutters Peeta. I ignore it
though because this really isn’t the time for me to be insulting
Haymitch, which is my first impulse.
I let Peeta doze off while his clothes dry out, but by late afternoon,
I don’t dare wait any longer. I gently shake his shoulder.
Peeta, we’ve got to go now.
Go? He seems confused. Go where?
Away from here. Downstream maybe. Somewhere we can
hide you until you’re stronger, I say. I help him dress, leaving
his feet bare so we can walk in the water, and pull him
upright. His face drains of color the moment he puts weight on
his leg. Come on. You can do this.
But he can’t. Not for long anyway. We make it about fifty
yards downstream, with him propped up by my shoulder, and
I can tell he’s going to black out. I sit him on the bank, push his
head between his knees, and pat his back awkwardly as I survey
the area. Of course, I’d love to get him up in a tree, but
that’s not going to happen. It could be worse though. Some of
the rocks form small cavelike structures. I set my sights on
one about twenty yards above the stream. When Peeta’s able
to stand, I half-guide, half-carry him up to the cave. Really, I’d
256
like to look around for a better place, but this one will have to
do because my ally is shot. Paper white, panting, and, even
though it’s only just cooling off, he’s shivering.
I cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine needles,
unroll my sleeping bag, and tuck him into it. I get a couple of
pills and some water into him when he’s not noticing, but he
refuses to eat even the fruit. Then he just lies there, his eyes
trained on my face as I build a sort of blind out of vines to
conceal the mouth of the cave. The result is unsatisfactory. An
animal might not question it, but a human would see hands
had manufactured it quickly enough. I tear it down in frustration.
Katniss, he says. I go over to him and brush the hair back
from his eyes. Thanks for finding me.
You would have found me if you could, I say. His forehead’s
burning up. Like the medicine’s having no effect at all.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, I’m scared he’s going to die.
Yes. Look, if I don’t make it back — he begins.
Don’t talk like that. I didn’t drain all that pus for nothing, I
say.
I know. But just in case I don’t — he tries to continue.
No, Peeta, I don’t even want to discuss it, I say, placing my
fingers on his lips to quiet him.
But I — he insists.
Impulsively, I lean forward and kiss him, stopping his
words. This is probably overdue anyway since he’s right, we
are supposed to be madly in love. It’s the first time I’ve ever
kissed a boy, which should make some sort of impression I
257
guess, but all I can register is how unnaturally hot his lips are
from the fever. I break away and pull the edge of the sleeping
bag up around him. You’re not going to die. I forbid it. All
right?
All right, he whispers.
I step out in the cool evening air just as the parachute floats
down from the sky. My fingers quickly undo the tie, hoping for
some real medicine to treat Peeta’s leg. Instead I find a pot of
hot broth.
Haymitch couldn’t be sending me a clearer message. One
kiss equals one pot of broth. I can almost hear his snarl.
You’re supposed to be in love, sweetheart. The boy’s dying.
Give me something I can work with!
And he’s right. If I want to keep Peeta alive, I’ve got to give
the audience something more to care about. Star-crossed lovers
desperate to get home together. Two hearts beating as
one. Romance.
Never having been in love, this is going to be a real trick. I
think of my parents. The way my father never failed to bring
her gifts from the woods. The way my mother’s face would
light up at the sound of his boots at the door. The way she almost
stopped living when he died.
Peeta! I say, trying for the special tone that my mother
used only with my father. He’s dozed off again, but I kiss him
awake, which seems to startle him. Then he smiles as if he’d
be happy to lie there gazing at me forever. He’s great at this
stuff.
I hold up the pot. Peeta, look what Haymitch has sent you.
258
Getting the broth into Peeta takes an hour of coaxing, begging,
threatening, and yes, kissing, but finally, sip by sip, he
empties the pot. I let him drift off to sleep then and attend to
my own needs, wolfing down a supper of groosling and roots
while I watch the daily report in the sky. No new casualties.
Still, Peeta and I have given the audience a fairly interesting
day. Hopefully, the Gamemakers will allow us a peaceful night.
I automatically look around for a good tree to nest in before
I realize that’s over. At least for a while. I can’t very well leave
Peeta unguarded on the ground. I left the scene of his last hiding
place on the bank of the stream untouched — how could I
conceal it? — and we’re a scant fifty yards downstream. I put
on my glasses, place my weapons in readiness, and settle
down to keep watch.
The temperature drops rapidly and soon I’m chilled to the
bone. Eventually, I give in and slide into the sleeping bag with
Peeta. It’s toasty warm and I snuggle down gratefully until I
realize it’s more than warm, it’s overly hot because the bag is
reflecting back his fever. I check his forehead and find it burning
and dry. I don’t know what to do. Leave him in the bag and
hope the excessive heat breaks the fever? Take him out and
hope the night air cools him off? I end up just dampening a
259
strip of bandage and placing it on his forehead. It seems weak,
but I’m afraid to do anything too drastic.
I spend the night half-sitting, half-lying next to Peeta, refreshing
the bandage, and trying not to dwell on the fact that
by teaming up with him, I’ve made myself far more vulnerable
than when I was alone. Tethered to the ground, on guard, with
a very sick person to take care of. But I knew he was injured.
And still I came after him. I’m just going to have to trust that
whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one.
When the sky turns rosy, I notice the sheen of sweat on
Peeta’s lip and discover the fever has broken. He’s not back to
normal, but it’s come down a few degrees. Last night, when I
was gathering vines, I came upon a bush of Rue’s berries. I
strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold water.
Peeta’s struggling to get up when I reach the cave. I woke
up and you were gone, he says. I was worried about you.
I have to laugh as I ease him back down. You were worried
about me? Have you taken a look at yourself lately?
I thought Cato and Clove might have found you. They like
to hunt at night, he says, still serious.
Clove? Which one is that? I ask.
The girl from District Two. She’s still alive, right? he says.
Yes, there’s just them and us and Thresh and Foxface, I
say. That’s what I nicknamed the girl from Five. How do you
feel?
260
Better than yesterday. This is an enormous improvement
over the mud, he says. Clean clothes and medicine and a
sleeping bag . . . and you.
Oh, right, the whole romance thing. I reach out to touch his
cheek and he catches my hand and presses it against his lips. I
remember my father doing this very thing to my mother and I
wonder where Peeta picked it up. Surely not from his father
and the witch.
No more kisses for you until you’ve eaten, I say.
We get him propped up against the wall and he obediently
swallows the spoonfuls of the berry mush I feed him. He refuses
the groosling again, though.
You didn’t sleep, Peeta says.
I’m all right, I say. But the truth is, I’m exhausted.
Sleep now. I’ll keep watch. I’ll wake you if anything happens,
he says. I hesitate. Katniss, you can’t stay up forever.
He’s got a point there. I’ll have to sleep eventually. And
probably better to do it now when he seems relatively alert
and we have daylight on our side. All right, I say. But just
for a few hours. Then you wake me.
It’s too warm for the sleeping bag now. I smooth it out on
the cave floor and lie down, one hand on my loaded bow in
case I have to shoot at a moment’s notice. Peeta sits beside
me, leaning against the wall, his bad leg stretched out before
him, his eyes trained on the world outside. Go to sleep, he
says softly. His hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off
my forehead. Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so far, this
gesture seems natural and comforting. I don’t want him to
261
stop and he doesn’t. He’s still stroking my hair when I fall asleep.
Too long. I sleep too long. I know from the moment I open
my eyes that we’re into the afternoon. Peeta’s right beside me,
his position unchanged. I sit up, feeling somehow defensive
but better rested than I’ve been in days.
Peeta, you were supposed to wake me after a couple of
hours, I say.
For what? Nothing’s going on here, he says. Besides I like
watching you sleep. You don’t scowl. Improves your looks a
lot.
This, of course, brings on a scowl that makes him grin.
That’s when I notice how dry his lips are. I test his cheek. Hot
as a coal stove. He claims he’s been drinking, but the containers
still feel full to me. I give him more fever pills and stand
over him while he drinks first one, then a second quart of water.
Then I tend to his minor wounds, the burns, the stings,
which are showing improvement. I steel myself and unwrap
the leg.
My heart drops into my stomach. It’s worse, much worse.
There’s no more pus in evidence, but the swelling has increased
and the tight shiny skin is inflamed. Then I see the red
streaks starting to crawl up his leg. Blood poisoning. Unchecked,
it will kill him for sure. My chewed-up leaves and
ointment won’t make a dent in it. We’ll need strong antiinfection
drugs from the Capitol. I can’t imagine the cost of
such potent medicine. If Haymitch pooled every donation
from every sponsor, would he have enough? I doubt it. Gifts go
262
up in price the longer the Games continue. What buys a full
meal on day one buys a cracker on day twelve. And the kind of
medicine Peeta needs would have been at a premium from the
beginning.
Well, there’s more swelling, but the pus is gone, I say in
an unsteady voice.
I know what blood poisoning is, Katniss, says Peeta.
Even if my mother isn’t a healer.
You’re just going to have to outlast the others, Peeta.
They’ll cure it back at the Capitol when we win, I say.
Yes, that’s a good plan, he says. But I feel this is mostly for
my benefit.
You have to eat. Keep your strength up. I’m going to make
you soup, I say.
Don’t light a fire, he says. It’s not worth it.
We’ll see, I say. As I take the pot down to the stream, I’m
struck by how brutally hot it is. I swear the Gamemakers are
progressively ratcheting up the temperature in the daytime
and sending it plummeting at night. The heat of the sun-baked
stones by the stream gives me an idea though. Maybe I won’t
need to light a fire.
I settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the stream
and the cave. After purifying half a pot of water, I place it in
direct sunlight and add several egg-size hot stones to the water.
I’m the first to admit I’m not much of a cook. But since
soup mainly involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting,
it’s one of my better dishes. I mince groosling until it’s practically
mush and mash some of Rue’s roots. Fortunately, they’ve
263
both been roasted already so they mostly need to be heated
up. Already, between the sunlight and the rocks, the water’s
warm. I put in the meat and roots, swap in fresh rocks, and go
find something green to spice it up a little. Before long, I discover
a tuft of chives growing at the base of some rocks. Perfect.
I chop them very fine and add them to the pot, switch out
the rocks again, put on the lid, and let the whole thing stew.
I’ve seen very few signs of game around, but I don’t feel
comfortable leaving Peeta alone while I hunt, so I rig half a
dozen snares and hope I get lucky. I wonder about the other
tributes, how they’re managing now that their main source of
food has been blown up. At least three of them, Cato, Clove,
and Foxface, had been relying on it. Probably not Thresh
though. I’ve got a feeling he must share some of Rue’s knowledge
on how to feed yourself from the earth. Are they fighting
each other? Looking for us? Maybe one of them has located us
and is just waiting for the right moment to attack. The idea
sends me back to the cave.
Peeta’s stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the
shade of the rocks. Although he brightens a bit when I come
in, it’s clear he feels miserable. I put cool cloths on his head,
but they warm up almost as soon as they touch his skin.
Do you want anything? I ask.
No, he says. Thank you. Wait, yes. Tell me a story.
A story? What about? I say. I’m not much for storytelling.
It’s kind of like singing. But once in a while, Prim wheedles
one out of me.
264
Something happy. Tell me about the happiest day you can
remember, says Peeta.
Something between a sigh and a huff of exasperation leaves
my mouth. A happy story? This will require a lot more effort
than the soup. I rack my brains for good memories. Most of
them involve Gale and me out hunting and somehow I don’t
think these will play well with either Peeta or the audience.
That leaves Prim.
Did I ever tell you about how I got Prim’s goat? I ask. Peeta
shakes his head, and looks at me expectantly. So I begin. But
carefully. Because my words are going out all over Panem.
And while people have no doubt put two and two together
that I hunt illegally, I don’t want to hurt Gale or Greasy Sae or
the butcher or even the Peacekeepers back home who are my
customers by publicly announcing they’d breaking the law,
too.
Here’s the real story of how I got the money for Prim’s goat,
Lady. It was a Friday evening, the day before Prim’s tenth
birthday in late May. As soon as school ended, Gale and I hit
the woods, because I wanted to get enough to trade for a
present for Prim. Maybe some new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush.
Our snares had done well enough and the woods were
flush with greens, but this was really no more than our average
Friday-night haul. I was disappointed as we headed back,
even though Gale said we’d be sure to do better tomorrow. We
were resting a moment by a stream when we saw him. A
young buck, probably a yearling by his size. His antlers were
265
just growing in, still small and coated in velvet. Poised to run
but unsure of us, unfamiliar with humans. Beautiful.
Less beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught him,
one in the neck, the other in the chest. Gale and I had shot at
the same time. The buck tried to run but stumbled, and Gale’s
knife slit his throat before he knew what had happened. Momentarily,
I’d felt a pang at killing something so fresh and innocent.
And then my stomach rumbled at the thought of all
that fresh and innocent meat.
A deer! Gale and I have only brought down three in all. The
first one, a doe that had injured her leg somehow, almost
didn’t count. But we knew from that experience not to go
dragging the carcass into the Hob. It had caused chaos with
people bidding on parts and actually trying to hack off pieces
themselves. Greasy Sae had intervened and sent us with our
deer to the butcher, but not before it’d been badly damaged,
hunks of meat taken, the hide riddled with holes. Although
everybody paid up fairly, it had lowered the value of the kill.
This time, we waited until dark fell and slipped under a
hole in the fence close to the butcher. Even though we were
known hunters, it wouldn’t have been good to go carrying a
150-pound deer through the streets of District 12 in daylight
like we were rubbing it in the officials’ faces.
The butcher, a short, chunky woman named Rooba, came to
the back door when we knocked. You don’t haggle with Rooba.
She gives you one price, which you can take or leave, but it’s a
fair price. We took her offer on the deer and she threw in a
couple of venison steaks we could pick up after the butcher-
266
ing. Even with the money divided in two, neither Gale nor I
had held so much at one time in our lives. We decided to keep
it a secret and surprise our families with the meat and money
at the end of the next day.
This is where I really got the money for the goat, but I tell
Peeta I sold an old silver locket of my mother’s. That can’t hurt
anyone. Then I pick up the story in the late afternoon of Prim’s
birthday.
Gale and I went to the market on the square so that I could
buy dress materials. As I was running my fingers over a length
of thick blue cotton cloth, something caught my eye. There’s
an old man who keeps a small herd of goats on the other side
of the Seam. I don’t know his real name, everyone just calls
him the Goat Man. His joints are swollen and twisted in painful
angles, and he’s got a hacking cough that proves he spent
years in the mines. But he’s lucky. Somewhere along the way
he saved up enough for these goats and now has something to
do in his old age besides slowly starve to death. He’s filthy and
impatient, but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you
can afford it.
One of the goats, a white one with black patches, was lying
down in a cart. It was easy to see why. Something, probably a
dog, had mauled her shoulder and infection had set in. It was
bad, the Goat Man had to hold her up to milk her. But I
thought I knew someone who could fix it.
Gale,
 I whispered. I want that goat for Prim.
Owning a nanny goat can change your life in District 12.
The animals can live off almost anything, the Meadow’s a per-
267
fect feeding place, and they can give four quarts of milk a day.
To drink, to make into cheese, to sell. It’s not even against the
law.
She’s hurt pretty bad, said Gale. We better take a closer
look.
We went over and bought a cup of milk to share, then stood
over the goat as if idly curious.
Let her be, said the man.
Just looking, said Gale.
Well, look fast. She goes to the butcher soon. Hardly anyone
will buy her milk, and then they only pay half price, said
the man.
What’s the butcher giving for her? I asked.
The man shrugged. Hang around and see. I turned and
saw Rooba coming across the square toward us. Lucky thing
you showed up, said the Goat Man when she arrived. Girl’s
got her eye on your goat.
Not if she’s spoken for, I said carelessly.
Rooba looked me up and down then frowned at the goat.
She’s not. Look at that shoulder. Bet you half the carcass will
be too rotten for even sausage.
What? said the Goat Man. We had a deal.
We had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks. Not
that thing. Sell her to the girl if she’s stupid enough to take
her, said Rooba. As she marched off, I caught her wink.
The Goat Man was mad, but he still wanted that goal off his
hands. It took us half an hour to agree on the price. Quite a
crowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions. It was an
268
excellent deal if the goat lived; I’d been robbed if she died.
People took sides in the argument, but I took the goat.
Gale offered to carry her. I think he wanted to see the look
on Prim’s face as much as I did. In a moment of complete giddiness,
I bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck.
Then we hurried back to my house.
You should have seen Prim’s reaction when we walked in
with that goat. Remember this is a girl who wept to save that
awful old cat, Buttercup. She was so excited she started crying
and laughing all at once. My mother was less sure, seeing the
injury, but the pair of them went to work on it, grinding up
herbs and coaxing brews down the animal’s throat.
They sound like you, says Peeta. I had almost forgotten he
was there.
Oh, no, Peeta. They work magic. That thing couldn’t have
died if it tried, I say. But then I bite my tongue, realizing what
that must sound like to Peeta, who is dying, in my incompetent
hands.
Don’t worry. I’m not trying, he jokes. Finish the story.
Well, that’s it. Only I remember that night, Prim insisted on
sleeping with Lady on a blanket next to the fire. And just before
they drifted off, the goat licked her cheek, like it was giving
her a good night kiss or something, I say. It was already
mad about her.
Was it still wearing the pink ribbon? he asks.
I think so, I say. Why?
I’m just trying to get a picture, he says thoughtfully. I can
see why that day made you happy.
269
Well, I knew that goat would be a little gold mine, 1 say.
Yes, of course I was referring to that, not the lasting joy
you gave the sister you love so much you took her place in the
reaping, says Peeta drily.
The goat has paid for itself. Several times over, I say in a
superior tone.
Well, it wouldn’t dare do anything else after you saved its
life, says Peeta. I intend to do the same thing.
Really? What did you cost me again? I ask.
A lot of trouble. Don’t worry. You’ll get it all back, he says.
You’re not making sense, I say. I test his forehead. The
lever’s going nowhere but up. You’re a little cooler though.
The sound of the trumpets startles me. I’m on my feet and
at the mouth of the cave in a flash, not wanting to miss a syllable.
It’s my new best friend, Claudius Templesmith, and as I
expected, he’s inviting us to a feast. Well, we’re not that hungry
and I actually wave his offer away in indifference when he
says, Now hold on. Some of you may already be declining my
invitation. But this is no ordinary feast. Each of you needs
something desperately.
I do need something desperately. Something to heal Peeta’s
leg.
Each of you will find that something in a backpack, marked
with your district number, at the Cornucopia at dawn. Think
hard about refusing to show up. For some of you, this will be
your last chance, says Claudius.
270
There’s nothing else, just his words hanging in the air. I
jump as Peeta grips my shoulder from behind. No, he says.
You’re not risking your life for me.
Who said I was? I say.
So, you’re not going? he asks.
Of course, I’m not going. Give me some credit. Do you think
I’m running straight into some free-for-all against Cato and
Clove and Thresh? Don’t be stupid, I say, helping him back to
bed. I’ll let them fight it out, we’ll see who’s in the sky tomorrow
night and work out a plan from there.
You’re such a bad liar, Katniss. I don’t know how you’ve
survived this long. He begins to mimic me. I knew that goat
would be a little gold mine. You’re a little cooler though. Of
course, I’m not going. He shakes his head. Never gamble at
cards. You’ll lose your last coin, he says.
Anger flushes my face. All right, I am going, and you can’t
stop me!
I can follow you. At least partway. I may not make it to the
Cornucopia, but if I’m yelling your name, I bet someone can
find me. And then I’ll be dead for sure, he says.
You won’t get a hundred yards from here on that leg, I
say.
Then I’ll drag myself, says Peeta. You go and I’m going,
too.
He’s just stubborn enough and maybe just strong enough to
do it. Come howling after me in the woods. Even if a tribute
doesn’t find him, something else might. He can’t defend him-
271
self. I’d probably have to wall him up in the cave just to go myself.
And who knows what the exertion will do to him?
What am I supposed to do? Sit here and watch you die? I
say. He must know that’s not an option. That the audience
would hate me. And frankly, I would hate myself, too, if I
didn’t even try.
I won’t die. I promise. If you promise not to go, he says.
We’re at something of a stalemate. I know I can’t argue him
out of this one, so I don’t try. I pretend, reluctantly, to go
along. Then you have to do what I say. Drink your water,
wake me when I tell you, and eat every bite of the soup no
matter how disgusting it is! I snap at him.
Agreed. Is it ready? he asks.
Wait here, I say. The air’s gone cold even though the sun’s
still up. I’m right about the Gamemakers messing with the
temperature. I wonder if the thing someone needs desperately
is a good blanket. The soup is still nice and warm in its iron
pot. And actually doesn’t taste too bad.
Peeta eats without complaint, even scraping out the pot to
show his enthusiasm. He rambles on about how delicious it is,
which should be encouraging if you don’t know what fever
does to people. He’s like listening to Haymitch before the alcohol
has soaked him into incoherence. I give him another
dose of fever medicine before he goes off his head completely.
As I go down to the stream to wash up, all I can think is that
he’s going to die if I don’t get to that feast. I’ll keep him going
for a day or two, and then the infection will reach his heart or
272
his brain or his lungs and he’ll be gone. And I’ll be here all
alone. Again. Waiting for the others.
I’m so lost in thought that I almost miss the parachute, even
though it floats right by me. Then I spring after it, yanking it
from the water, tearing off the silver fabric to retrieve the vial.
Haymitch has done it! He’s gotten the medicine — I don’t
know how, persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell
their jewels — and I can save Peeta! It’s such a tiny vial
though. It must be very strong to cure someone as ill as Peeta.
A ripple of doubt runs through me. I uncork the vial and take a
deep sniff. My spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent. Just to be
sure, I place a drop on the tip of my tongue. There’s no question,
it’s sleep syrup. It’s a common medicine in District 12.
Cheap, as medicine goes, but very addictive. Almost everyone’s
had a dose at one time or another. We have some in a
bottle at home. My mother gives it to hysterical patients to
knock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds
or just to help someone in pain get through the night. It only
takes a little. A vial this size could knock Peeta out for a full
day, but what good is that? I’m so furious I’m about to throw
Haymitch’s last offering into the stream when it hits me. A full
day? That’s more than I need.
I mash up a handful of berries so the taste won’t be as noticeable
and add some mint leaves for good measure. Then I
head back up to the cave. I’ve brought you a treat. I found a
new patch of berries a little farther downstream.
Peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without hesitation.
He swallows then frowns slightly. They’re very sweet.
273
Yes, they’re sugar berries. My mother makes jam from
them. Haven’t you ever had them before? I say, poking the
next spoonful in his mouth.
No, he says, almost puzzled. But they taste familiar. Sugar
berries?
Well, you can’t get them in the market much, they only
grow wild, I say. Another mouthful goes down. Just one more
to go.
They’re sweet as syrup, he says, taking the last spoonful.
Syrup. His eyes widen as he realizes the truth. I clamp my
hand over his mouth and nose hard, forcing him to swallow
instead of spit. He tries to make himself vomit the stuff up, but
it’s too late, he’s already losing consciousness. Even as he
fades away, I can see in his eyes what I’ve done is unforgivable.
I sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture of
sadness and satisfaction. A stray berry stains his chin and I
wipe it away. Who can’t lie, Peeta? I say, even though he
can’t hear me.
It doesn’t matter. The rest of Panem can.
274
In the remaining hours before nightfall, I gather rocks and
do my best to camouflage the opening of the cave. It’s a slow
and arduous process, but after a lot of sweating and shifting
things around, I’m pretty pleased with my work, The cave now
appears to be part of a larger pile of rocks, like so many in the
vicinity. I can still crawl in to Peeta through a small opening,
but it’s undetectable from the out« side. That’s good, because
I’ll need to share that sleeping bag again tonight. Also, if I
don’t make it back from the feast, Peeta will be hidden but not
entirely imprisoned. Although I doubt he can hang on much
longer without medicine. If I die at the feast, District 12 isn’t
likely to have a victor.
I make a meal out of the smaller, bonier fish that inhabit the
stream down here, fill every water container and purify it, and
clean my weapons. I’ve nine arrows left in all. I debate leaving
the knife with Peeta so he’ll have some protection while I’m
gone, but there’s really no point. He was right about camouflage
being his final defense. But I still might have use for the
knife. Who knows what I’ll encounter?
Here are some things I’m fairly certain of. That at least Cato,
Clove, and Thresh will be on hand when the feast starts. I’m
not sure about Foxface since direct confrontation isn’t her
275
style or her forte. She’s even smaller than I am and unarmed,
unless she’s picked up some weapons recently. She’ll probably
be hanging somewhere nearby, seeing what she can scavenge.
But the other three . . . I’m going to have my hands full. My
ability to kill at a distance is my greatest asset, but I know I’ll
have to go right into the thick of things to get that backpack,
the one with the number 12 on it that Claudius Templesmith
mentioned.
I watch the sky, hoping for one less opponent at dawn, but
nobody appears tonight. Tomorrow there will be faces up
there. Feasts always result in fatalities.
I crawl into the cave, secure my glasses, and curl up next to
Peeta. Luckily I had that good long sleep today. I have to stay
awake. I don’t really think anyone will attack our cave tonight,
but I can’t risk missing the dawn.
So cold, so bitterly cold tonight. As if the Gamemakers have
sent an infusion of frozen air across the arena, which may be
exactly what they’ve done. I lay next to Peeta in the bag, trying
to absorb every bit of his fever heat. It’s strange to be so physically
close to someone who’s so distant. Peeta might as well
be back in the Capitol, or in District 12, or on the moon right
now, he’d be no harder to reach. I’ve never felt lonelier since
the Games began.
Just accept it will be a bad night, I tell myself. I try not to,
but I can’t help thinking of my mother and Prim, wondering if
they’ll sleep a wink tonight. At this late stage in the Games,
with an important event like the feast, school will probably be
canceled. My family can either watch on that static-filled old
276
clunker of a television at home or join the crowds in the
square to watch on the big, clear screens, They’ll have privacy
at home but support in the square. People will give them a
kind word, a bit of food if they can spare it. I wonder if the
baker has sought them out, especially now that Peeta and I are
a team, and made good on his promise to keep my sister’s belly
full.
Spirits must be running high in District 12. We so rarely
have anyone to root for at this point in the Games. Surely,
people are excited about Peeta and me, especially now that
we’re together. If I close my eyes, I can imagine their shouts at
the screens, urging us on. I see their faces — Greasy Sac and
Madge and even the Peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering
for us.
And Gale. I know him. He won’t be shouting and cheering.
But he’ll be watching, every moment, every twist and turn,
and willing me to come home. I wonder if he’s hoping that
Peeta makes it as well. Gale’s not my boyfriend, but would he
be, if I opened that door? He talked about us running away together.
Was that just a practical calculation of our chances of
survival away from the district? Or something more?
I wonder what he makes of all this kissing.
Through a crack in the rocks, I watch the moon cross the
sky. At what I judge to be about three hours before dawn, I
begin final preparations. I’m careful to leave Peeta with water
and the medical kit right beside him. Nothing else will be of
much use if I don’t return, and even these would only prolong
his life a short time. After some debate, I strip him of his jacket
277
and zip it on over my own. He doesn’t need it. Not now in the
sleeping bag with his fever, and during the day, if I’m not there
to remove it, he’ll be roasting in it. My hands are already stiff
from cold, so I take Rue’s spare pair of socks, cut holes for my
fingers and thumbs, and pull them on. It helps anyway. I fill
her small pack with some food, a water bottle, and bandages,
tuck the knife in my belt, get my bow and arrows. I’m about to
leave when I remember the importance of sustaining the starcrossed
lover routine and I lean over and give Peeta a long,
lingering kiss. I imagine the teary sighs emanating from the
Capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of my own. Then I
squeeze through the opening in the rocks out into the night.
My breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air. It’s as
cold as a November night at home. One where I’ve slipped into
the woods, lantern in hand, to join Gale at some prearranged
place where we’ll sit bundled together, sipping herb tea from
metal flasks wrapped in quilting, hoping game will pass our
way as the morning comes on. Oh, Gale, I think. If only you had
my back now . . .
I move as fast as I dare. The glasses are quite remarkable,
but I still sorely miss having the use of my left ear. I don’t
know what the explosion did, but it damaged something deep
and irreparable. Never mind. If I get home, I’ll be so stinking
rich, I’ll be able to pay someone to do my hearing.
The woods always look different at night. Even with the
glasses, everything has an unfamiliar slant to it. As if the daytime
trees and flowers and stones had gone to bed and sent
slightly more ominous versions of themselves to take their
278
places. I don’t try anything tricky, like taking a new route. I
make my way back up the stream and follow the same path
back to Rue’s hiding place near the lake. Along the way, I see
no sign of another tribute, not a puff of breath, not a quiver of
a branch. Either I’m the first to arrive or the others positioned
themselves last night. There’s still more than an hour, maybe
two, when I wriggle into the underbrush and wait for the
blood to begin to flow.
I chew a few mint leaves, my stomach isn’t up for much
more. Thank goodness, I have Peeta’s jacket as well as my
own. If not, I’d be forced to move around to stay warm. The
sky turns a misty morning gray and still there’s no sign of the
other tributes. It’s not surprising really. Everyone has distinguished
themselves either by strength or deadliness or cunning.
Do they suppose, I wonder, that I have Peeta with me? I
doubt Foxface and Thresh even know he was wounded. All the
better if they think he’s covering me when I go in for the
backpack.
But where is it? The arena has lightened enough for me to
remove my glasses. I can hear the morning birds singing. Isn’t
it time? For a second, I’m panicked that I’m at the wrong location.
But no, I’m certain I remember Claudius Templesmith
specifying the Cornucopia. And there it is. And here I am. So
where’s my feast?
Just as the first ray of sun glints off the gold Cornucopia,
there’s a disturbance on the plain. The ground before the
mouth of the horn splits in two and a round table with a
snowy white cloth rises into the arena. On the table sit four
279
backpacks, two large black ones with the numbers 2 and 11, a
medium-size green one with the number 5, and a tiny orange
one — really I could carry it around my wrist — that must be
marked with a 12.
The table has just clicked into place when a figure darts out
of the Cornucopia, snags the green backpack, and speeds off.
Foxface! Leave it to her to come up with such a clever and
risky idea! The rest of us are still poised around the plain, sizing
up the situation, and she’s got hers. She’s got us trapped,
too, because no one wants to chase her down, not while their
own pack sits so vulnerable on the table. Foxface must have
purposefully left the other packs alone, knowing that to steal
one without her number would definitely bring on a pursuer.
That should have been my strategy! By the lime I’ve worked
through the emotions of surprise, admiration, anger, jealousy,
and frustration, I’m watching that reddish mane of hair disappear
into the trees well out of shooting range. Huh. I’m always
dreading the others, but maybe Foxface is the real opponent
here.
She’s cost me time, too, because by now it’s clear that I
must get to the table next. Anyone who beats me to it will
easily scoop up my pack and be gone. Without hesitation, I
sprint for the table. I can sense the emergence of danger before
I see it. Fortunately, the first knife comes whizzing in on
my right side so I can hear it and I’m able to deflect it with my
bow. I turn, drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow
straight at Clove’s heart. She turns just enough to avoid a fatal
hit, but the point punctures her upper left arm. Unfortunately,
280
she throws with her right, but it’s enough to slow her down a
few moments, having to pull the arrow from her arm, take in
the severity of the wound. I keep moving, positioning the next
arrow automatically, as only someone who has hunted for
years can do.
I’m at the table now, my fingers closing over the tiny
orange backpack. My hand slips between the straps and I yank
it up on my arm, it’s really too small to fit on any other part of
my anatomy, and I’m turning to fire again when the second
knife catches me in the forehead. It slices above my right eyebrow,
opening a gash that sends a gush running down my face,
blinding my eye, filling my mouth with the sharp, metallic
taste of my own blood. I stagger backward but still manage to
send my readied arrow in the general direction of my assailant.
I know as it leaves my hands it will miss. And then Clove
slams into me, knocking me flat on my back, pinning my
shoulders to the ground, with her knees.
This is it, I think, and hope for Prim’s sake it will be fast. But
Clove means to savor the moment. Even feels she has time. No
doubt Cato is somewhere nearby, guarding her, waiting for
Thresh and possibly Peeta.
Where’s your boyfriend, District Twelve? Still hanging
on? she asks.
Well, as long as we’re talking I’m alive. He’s out there now.
Hunting Cato, I snarl at her. Then I scream at the top of my
lungs. Peeta!
Clove jams her fist into my windpipe, very effectively cutting
off my voice. But her head’s whipping from side to side,
281
and I know for a moment she’s at least considering I’m telling
the truth. Since no Peeta appears to save me, she turns back to
me.
Liar, she says with a grin. He’s nearly dead. Cato knows
where he cut him. You’ve probably got him strapped up in
some tree while you try to keep his heart going. What’s in the
pretty little backpack? That medicine for Lover Boy? Too bad
he’ll never get it.
Clove opens her jacket. It’s lined with an impressive array
of knives. She carefully selects an almost dainty-looking number
with a cruel, curved blade. I promised Cato if he let me
have you, I’d give the audience a good show.
I’m struggling now in an effort to unseat her, but it’s no use.
She’s too heavy and her lock on me too tight.
Forget it, District Twelve. We’re going to kill you. Just like
we did your pathetic little ally . . . what was her name? The
one who hopped around in the trees? Rue? Well, first Rue,
then you, and then I think we’ll just let nature take care of
Lover Boy. How does that sound? Clove asks. Now, where to
start?
She carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound with
her jacket sleeve. For a moment, she surveys my face, tilting it
from side to side as if it’s a block of wood and she’s deciding
exactly what pattern to carve on it. I attempt to bite her hand,
but she grabs the hair on the top of my head, forcing me back
to the ground. I think . . . she almost purrs. I think we’ll start
with your mouth. I clamp my teeth together as she teasingly
traces the outline of my lips with the tip of the blade.
282
I won’t close my eyes. The comment about Rue has filled
me with fury, enough fury I think to die with some dignity. As
my last act of defiance, I will stare her down as long as I can
see, which will probably not be an extended period of time,
but I will stare her down, I will not cry out. I will die, in my
own small way, undefeated.
Yes, I don’t think you’ll have much use for your lips anymore.
Want to blow Lover Boy one last kiss? she asks, I work
up a mouthful of blood and saliva and spit it in her face. She
flushes with rage. All right then. Let’s get started.
I brace myself for the agony that’s sure to follow. But as I
feel the tip open the first cut at my lip, some great form yanks
Clove from my body and then she’s screaming. I’m too
stunned at first, too unable to process what has happened. Has
Peeta somehow come to my rescue? Have the Gamemakers
sent in some wild animal to add to the fun? Has a hovercraft
inexplicably plucked her into the air?
But when I push myself up on my numb arms, I see it’s
none of the above. Clove is dangling a foot off the ground, imprisoned
in Thresh’s arms. I let out a gasp, seeing him like
that, towering over me, holding Clove like a rag doll. I remember
him as big, but he seems more massive, more powerful
than I even recall. If anything, he seems to have gained weight
in the arena. He flips Clove around and flings her onto the
ground.
When he shouts, I jump, never having heard him speak
above a mutter. What’d you do to that little girl? You kill
her?
283
Clove is scrambling backward on all fours, like a frantic insect,
too shocked to even call for Cato. No! No, it wasn’t me!
You said her name. I heard you. You kill her? Another
thought brings a fresh wave of rage to his features. You cut
her up like you were going to cut up this girl here?
No! No, I — Clove sees the stone, about the size of a small
loaf of bread in Thresh’s hand and loses it. Cato! she
screeches. Cato!
Clove! I hear Cato’s answer, but he’s too far away, I can
tell that much, to do her any good. What was he doing? Trying
to get Foxface or Peeta? Or had he been lying in wait for
Thresh and just badly misjudged his location?
Thresh brings the rock down hard against Clove’s temple.
It’s not bleeding, but I can see the dent in her skull and I know
that she’s a goner. There’s still life in her now though, in the
rapid rise and fall of her chest, the low moan escaping her lips.
When Thresh whirls around on me, the rock raised, I know
it’s no good to run. And my bow is empty, the last loaded arrow
having gone in Clove’s direction. I’m trapped in the glare
of his strange golden brown eyes. What’d she mean? About
Rue being your ally?
I — I — we teamed up. Blew up the supplies. I tried to
save her, I did. But he got there first. District One, I say. Maybe
if he knows I helped Rue, he won’t choose some slow, sadistic
end for me.
And you killed him? he demands.
Yes. I killed him. And buried her in flowers, I say. And I
sang her to sleep.
284
Tears spring in my eyes. The tension, the fight goes out of
me at the memory. And I’m overwhelmed by Rue, and the pain
in my head, and my fear of Thresh, and the moaning of the dying
girl a few feet away.
To sleep? Thresh says gruffly.
To death. I sang until she died, I say. Your district. . . they
sent me bread. My hand reaches up but not for an arrow that
I know I’ll never reach. Just to wipe my nose. Do it fast, okay,
Thresh?
Conflicting emotions cross Thresh’s face. He lowers the
rock and points at me, almost accusingly. Just this one time, I
let you go. For the little girl. You and me, we’re even then. No
more owed. You understand?
I nod because I do understand. About owing. About hating
it. I understand that if Thresh wins, he’ll have to go back and
face a district that has already broken all the rules to thank
me, and he is breaking the rules to thank me, too. And I understand
that, for the moment, Thresh is not going to smash in
my skull.
Clove! Cato’s voice is much nearer now. I can tell by the
pain in it that he sees her on the ground.
You better run now, Fire Girl, says Thresh.
I don’t need to be told twice. I flip over and my feet dip into
the hard-packed earth as I run away from Thresh and Clove
and the sound of Cato’s voice. Only when I reach the woods do
I turn back for an instant. Thresh and both large backpacks
are vanishing over the edge of the plain into the area I’ve never
seen. Cato kneels beside Clove, spear in hand, begging her
285
to stay with him. In a moment, he will realize it’s futile, she
can’t be saved. I crash into the trees, repeatedly swiping away
the blood that’s pouring into my eye, fleeing like the wild,
wounded creature I am. After a few minutes, I hear the cannon
and I know that Clove has died, that Cato will be on one of our
trails. Either Thresh’s or mine. I’m seized with terror, weak
from my head wound, shaking. I load an arrow, but Cato can
throw that spear almost as far as I can shoot.
Only one thing calms me down. Thresh has Cato’s backpack
containing the thing he needs desperately. If I had to bet, Cato
headed out after Thresh, not me. Still I don’t slow down when
I reach the water. I plunge right in, boots still on, and flounder
downstream. I pull off Rue’s socks that I’ve been using for
gloves and press them into my forehead, trying to staunch the
flow of blood, but they’re soaked in minutes.
Somehow I make it back to the cave. I squeeze through the
rocks. In the dappled light, I pull the little orange backpack
from my arm, cut open the clasp, and dump the contents on
the ground. One slim box containing one hypodermic needle.
Without hesitating, I jam the needle into Peeta’s arm and
slowly press down on the plunger.
My hands go to my head and then drop to my lap, slick with
blood.
The last thing I remember is an exquisitely beautiful greenand-silver
moth landing on the curve of my wrist.
286
The sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house gently
pulls me toward consciousness. I fight to return to sleep
though, wrapped in a warm cocoon of blankets, safe at home.
I’m vaguely aware that my head aches. Possibly I have the flu
and this is why I’m allowed to stay in bed, even though I can
tell I’ve been asleep a long time. My mother’s hand strokes my
cheek and I don’t push it away as I would in wakefulness, never
wanting her to know how much I crave that gentle touch.
How much I miss her even though I still don’t trust her. Then
there’s a voice, the wrong voice, not my mother’s, and I’m
scared.
Katniss, it says. Katniss, can you hear me?
My eyes open and the sense of security vanishes. I’m not
home, not with my mother. I’m in a dim, chilly cave, my bare
feet freezing despite the cover, the air tainted with the unmistakable
smell of blood. The haggard, pale face of a boy slides
into view, and after an initial jolt of alarm, I feel better. Peeta.
Hey, he says. Good to see your eyes again.
How long have I been out? I ask.
287
Not sure. I woke up yesterday evening and you were lying
next to me in a very scary pool of blood, he says. I think it’s
stopped finally, but I wouldn’t sit up or anything.
I gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it bandaged.
This simple gesture leaves me weak and dizzy. Peeta holds a
bottle to my lips and I drink thirstily.
You’re better, I say.
Much better. Whatever you shot into my arm did the
trick, he says. By this morning, almost all the swelling in my
leg was gone.
He doesn’t seem angry about my tricking him, drugging
him, and running off to the feast. Maybe I’m just too beat-up
and I’ll hear about it later when I’m stronger. But for the moment,
he’s all gentleness.
Did you eat? I ask.
I’m sorry to say I gobbled down three pieces of that groosling
before I realized it might have to last a while. Don’t worry,
I’m back on a strict diet, he says.
No, it’s good. You need to eat. I’ll go hunting soon, I say.
Not too soon, all right? he says. You just let me take care
of you for a while.
I don’t really seem to have much choice. Peeta feeds me bites
of groosling and raisins and makes me drink plenty of water.
He rubs some warmth back into my feet and wraps them
in his jacket before tucking the sleeping bag back up around
my chin.
Your boots and socks are still damp and the weather’s not
helping much, he says. There’s a clap of thunder, and I see
288
lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks.
Rain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but Peeta has
built a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging
the square of plastic into the rock above me.
I wonder what brought on this storm? I mean, who’s the
target? says Peeta.
Cato and Thresh, I say without thinking. Foxface will be
in her den somewhere, and Clove . . . she cut me an then . . .
My voice trails off.
I know Clove’s dead. I saw it in the sky last night, h says.
Did you kill her?
No. Thresh broke her skull with a rock, I say.
Lucky he didn’t catch you, too, says Peeta.
The memory of the feast returns full-force and I feel sick.
He did. But he let me go. Then, of course, I have to tell him.
About things I’ve kept to myself because he was too sick to ask
and I wasn’t ready to relive anyway. Like the explosion and
my ear and Rue’s dying and the boy from District 1 and the
bread. All of which leads to what happened with Thresh and
how he was paying off a debt of sorts.
He let you go because he didn’t want to owe you anything?
asks Peeta in disbelief.
Yes. I don’t expect you to understand it. You’ve always had
enough. But if you’d lived in the Seam, I wouldn’t have to explain,
I say.
And don’t try. Obviously I’m too dim to get it.
It’s like the bread. How I never seem to get over owing you
for that, I say.
289
The bread? What? From when we were kids? he says. I
think we can let that go. I mean, you just brought me back
from the dead.
But you didn’t know me. We had never even spoken. Besides,
it’s the first gift that’s always the hardest to pay back. I
wouldn’t even have been here to do it if you hadn’t helped me
then, I say. Why did you, anyway?
Why? You know why, Peeta says. I give my head a slight,
painful shake. Haymitch said you would take a lot of convincing.
Haymitch? I ask. What’s he got to do with it?
Nothing, Peeta says. So, Cato and Thresh, huh? I guess
it’s too much to hope that they’ll simultaneously destroy each
other?
But the thought only upsets me. I think we would like
Thresh. I think he’d be our friend back in District Twelve, I
say.
Then let’s hope Cato kills him, so we don’t have to, says
Peeta grimly.
I don’t want Cato to kill Thresh at all. I don’t want anyone
else to die. But this is absolutely not the kind of thing that victors
go around saying in the arena. Despite my best efforts, I
can feel tears starting to pool in my eyes.
Peeta looks at me in concern. What is it? Are you in a lot of
pain?
I give him another answer, because it is equally true but
can be taken as a brief moment of weakness instead of a ter-
290
minal one. I want to go home, Peeta, I say plaintively, like a
small child.
You will. I promise, he says, and bends over to give me a
kiss.
I want to go home now, I say.
Tell you what. You go back to sleep and dream of home.
And you’ll be there for real before you know it, lie says.
Okay?
Okay, I whisper. Wake me if you need me to keep watch.
I’m good and rested, thanks to you and Haymitch. Besides,
who knows how long this will last? he says.
What does he mean? The storm? The brief respite ii brings
us? The Games themselves? I don’t know, but I’m ion sad and
tired to ask.
It’s evening when Peeta wakes me again. The rain has
turned to a downpour, sending streams of water through our
ceiling where earlier there had been only drips. Peeta has
placed the broth pot under the worst one and repositioned the
plastic to deflect most of it from me. I feel a bit better, able to
sit up without getting too dizzy, and I’m absolutely famished.
So is Peeta. It’s clear he’s been waiting for me to wake up to
eat and is eager to get started.
There’s not much left. Two pieces of groosling, a small
mishmash of roots, and a handful of dried fruit.
Should we try and ration it? Peeta asks.
No, let’s just finish it. The groosling’s getting old anyway,
and the last thing we need is to get sick off spoilt food, I say,
dividing the food into two equal piles. We try and eat slowly,
291
but we’re both so hungry were done in a couple of minutes.
My stomach is in no way satisfied. Tomorrow’s a hunting
day, I say.
I won’t be much help with that, Peeta says. I’ve never
hunted before.
I’ll kill and you cook, I say. And you can always gather.
I wish there was some sort of bread bush out there, says
Peeta.
The bread they sent me from District Eleven was still
warm, I say with a sigh. Here, chew these. I hand him a
couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own mouth.
It’s hard to even see the projection in the sky, but it’s clear
enough to know there were no more deaths today. So Cato
and Thresh haven’t had it out yet.
Where did Thresh go? I mean, what’s on the far side of the
circle? I ask Peeta.
A field. As far as you can see it’s full of grasses as high as
my shoulders. I don’t know, maybe some of them are grain.
There are patches of different colors. But there are no paths,
says Peeta.
I bet some of them are grain. I bet Thresh knows which
ones, too, I say. Did you go in there?
No. Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in that
grass. It has a sinister feeling to it. Every time I look at that
field, all I can think of are hidden things. Snakes, and rabid animals,
and quicksand, Peeta says. There could be anything in
there.
292
I don’t say so but Peeta’s words remind me of the warnings
they give us about not going beyond the fence in District 12. I
can’t help, for a moment, comparing him with Gale, who
would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a
threat. Thresh certainly did. It’s not that Peeta’s soft exactly,
and he’s proved he’s not a coward. But there are things you
don’t question too much, I guess, when your home always
smells like baking bread, whereas Gale questions everything.
What would Peeta think of the irreverent banter that passes
between us as we break the law each day? Would it shock
him? The things we say about Panem? Gale’s tirades against
the Capitol?
Maybe there is a bread bush in that field, I say. Maybe
that’s why Thresh looks better fed now than when we started
the Games.
Either that or he’s got very generous sponsors, says Peeta.
I wonder what we’d have to do to get Haymitch to send us
some bread.
I raise my eyebrows before I remember he doesn’t know
about the message Haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago.
One kiss equals one pot of broth. It’s not the sort of thing I can
blurt out, either. To say my thoughts aloud would be tipping
off the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play
on their sympathies and that would result in no food at all.
Somehow, believably, I’ve got to get things back on track.
Something simple to start with. I reach out and take his hand.
Well, he probably used up a lot of resources helping me
knock you out, I say mischievously.
293
Yeah, about that, says Peeta, entwining his fingers in
mine. Don’t try something like that again.
Or what? I ask.
Or . . . or . . . He can’t think of anything good. Just give me
a minute.
What’s the problem? I say with a grin.
The problem is we’re both still alive. Which only reinforces
the idea in your mind that you did the right thing, says
Peeta.
I did do the right thing, I say.
No! Just don’t, Katniss! His grip tightens, hurting my hand,
and there’s real anger in his voice. Don’t die for me. You
won’t be doing me any favors. All right?
I’m startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent opportunity
for getting food, so I try to keep up. Maybe I did it
for myself, Peeta, did you ever think of that? Maybe you aren’t
the only one who . . . who worries about . . . what it would be
like if. . .
I fumble. I’m not as smooth with words as Peeta. And while
I was talking, the idea of actually losing Peeta hit me again and
I realized how much I don’t want him to die. And it’s not about
the sponsors. And it’s not about what will happen back home.
And it’s not just that I don’t want to be alone. It’s him. I do not
want to lose the boy with the bread.
If what, Katniss? he says softly.
I wish I could pull the shutters closed, blocking out this
moment from the prying eyes of Panem. Even if it means losing
food. Whatever I’m feeling, it’s no one’s business but mine.
294
That’s exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to steer
clear of, I say evasively, although Haymitch never said anything
of the kind. In fact, he’s probably cursing me out right
now for dropping the ball during such an emotionally charged
moment. But Peeta somehow catches it.
Then I’ll just have to fill in the blanks myself, he says, and
moves in to me.
This is the first kiss that we’re both fully aware of. Neither
of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious. Our
lips neither burning with fever or icy cold. This is the first kiss
where I actually feel stirring inside my chest. Warm and curious.
This is the first kiss that makes me want another.
But I don’t get it. Well, I do get a second kiss, but it’s just a
light one on the tip of my nose because Peeta’s been distracted.
I think your wound is bleeding again. Come on, lie
down, it’s bedtime anyway, he says.
My socks are dry enough to wear now. I make Peeta put his
jacket back on. The damp cold seems to cut right down to my
bones, so he must be half frozen. I insist on taking the first
watch, too, although neither of us think it’s likely anyone will
come in this weather. But he won’t agree unless I’m in the bag,
too, and I’m shivering so hard that it’s pointless to object. In
stark contrast to two nights ago, when I felt Peeta was a million
miles away, I’m struck by his immediacy now. As we settle
in, he pulls my head down to use his arm as a pillow, the
other rests protectively over me even when he goes to sleep.
No one has held me like this in such a long time. Since my fa-
295
ther died and I stopped trusting my mother, no one else’s
arms have made me feel this safe.
With the aid of the glasses, I lie watching the drips of water
splatter on the cave floor. Rhythmic and lulling. Several times,
I drift off briefly and then snap awake, guilty and angry with
myself. After three or four hours, I can’t help it, I have to rouse
Peeta because I can’t keep my eyes open. He doesn’t seem to
mind.
Tomorrow, when it’s dry, I’ll find us a place so high in the
trees we can both sleep in peace, I promise as I drift off.
But tomorrow is no better in terms of weather. The deluge
continues as if the Gamemakers are intent on washing us all
away. The thunder’s so powerful it seems to shake the ground.
Peeta’s considering heading out anyway to scavenge for food,
but I tell him in this storm it would be pointless. He won’t be
able to see three feet in front of his face and he’ll only end up
getting soaked to the skin for his troubles. He knows I’m right,
but the gnawing in our stomachs is becoming painful.
The day drags on turning into evening and there’s no break
in the weather. Haymitch is our only hope, but nothing is
forthcoming, either from lack of money — everything will cost
an exorbitant amount — or because he’s dissatisfied with our
performance. Probably the latter. I’d be the first to admit
we’re not exactly riveting today. Starving, weak from injuries,
trying not to reopen wounds. We’re sitting huddled together
wrapped in the sleeping bag, yes, but mostly to keep warm.
The most exciting thing either of us does is nap.
296
I’m not really sure how to ramp up the romance. The kiss
last night was nice, but working up to another will take some
forethought. There are girls in the Seam, some of the merchant
girls, too, who navigate these waters so easily. But I’ve
never had much time or use for it. Anyway, just a kiss isn’t
enough anymore clearly because if it was we’d have gotten
food last night. My instincts tell me Haymitch isn’t just looking
for physical affection, he wants something more personal. The
sort of stuff he was trying to get me to tell about myself when
we were practicing for the interview. I’m rotten at it, but Peeta’s
not. Maybe the best approach is to get him talking.
Peeta, I say lightly. You said at the interview you’d had a
crush on me forever. When did forever start?
Oh, let’s see. I guess the first day of school. We were five.
You had on a red plaid dress and your hair . . . it was in two
braids instead of one. My father pointed you out when we
were waiting to line up, Peeta says.
Your father? Why? I ask.
He said, ‘See that little girl? I wanted to marry her mother,
but she ran off with a coal miner,’ Peeta says.
What? You’re making that up! I exclaim.
No, true story, Peeta says. And I said, ‘A coal miner? Why
did she want a coal miner if she could’ve had you?’ And he
said, ‘Because when he sings . . . even the birds stop to listen.’
That’s true. They do. I mean, they did, I say. I’m stunned
and surprisingly moved, thinking of the baker telling this to
Peeta. It strikes me that my own reluctance to sing, my own
dismissal of music might not really be that I think it’s a waste
297
of time. It might be because it reminds me too much of my father.
So that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked who
knew the valley song. Your hand shot right up in the air. She
stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us. And I swear,
every bird outside the windows fell silent, Peeta says.
Oh, please, I say, laughing.
No, it happened. And right when your song ended, I knew
— just like your mother — I was a goner, Peeta says. Then
for the next eleven years, I tried to work up the nerve to talk
to you.
Without success, I add.
Without success. So, in a way, my name being drawn in the
reaping was a real piece of luck, says Peeta.
For a moment, I’m almost foolishly happy and then confusion
sweeps over me. Because we’re supposed to be making
up this stuff, playing at being in love not actually being in love.
But Peeta’s story has a ring of truth to it. That part about my
father and the birds. And I did sing the first day of school, although
I don’t remember the song. And that red plaid dress . . .
there was one, a hand-me-down to Prim that got washed to
rags after my father’s death.
It would explain another thing, too. Why Peeta took a beating
to give me the bread on that awful hollow day. So, if those
details are true . . . could it all be true?
You have a . . . remarkable memory, I say haltingly.
298
I remember everything about you, says Peeta, tucking a
loose strand of hair behind my ear. You’re the one who
wasn’t paying attention.
I am now, I say.
Well, I don’t have much competition here, he says.
I want to draw away, to close those shutters again, but I
know I can’t. It’s as if I can hear Haymitch whispering in my
ear, Say it! Say it!
I swallow hard and get the words out. You don’t have
much competition anywhere. And this time, it’s me who leans
in.
Our lips have just barely touched when the clunk outside
makes us jump. My bow comes up, the arrow ready to fly, but
there’s no other sound. Peeta peers through the rocks and
then gives a whoop. Before I can stop him, lie’s out in the rain,
then handing something in to me. A silver parachute attached
to a basket. I rip it open at once and inside there’s a feast —
fresh rolls, goat cheese, apples, and best of all, a tureen of that
incredible lamb stew on wild rice. The very dish I told Caesar
Flickerman was the most impressive thing the Capitol had to
offer.
Peeta wriggles back inside, his face lit up like the sun. I
guess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us starve.
I guess so, I answer.
But in my head I can hear Haymitch’s smug, if slightly exasperated,
words, Yes, that’s what I’m looking lot, sweetheart.
299
Every cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew and
cram it, handful by handful into my mouth. But Peeta’s voice
stops me. We better take it slow on that stew. Remember the
first night on the train? The rich food made me sick and I
wasn’t even starving then.
You’re right. And I could just inhale the whole thing! I say
regretfully. But I don’t. We are quite sensible. We each have a
roll, half an apple, and an egg-size serving of stew and rice. I
make myself eat the stew in tiny spoonfuls — they even sent
us silverware and plates — savoring each bite. When we
finish, I stare longingly at the dish. I want more.
Me, too. Tell you what. We wait an hour, if it stays down,
then we get another serving, Peeta says.
Agreed, I say. It’s going to be a long hour.
Maybe not that long, says Peeta. What was that you were
saying just before the food arrived? Something about me . . .
no competition . . . best thing that ever happened to you . . .
I don’t remember that last part, I say, hoping it’s too dim
in here for the cameras to pick up my blush.
Oh, that’s right. That’s what I was thinking, he says. Scoot
over, I’m freezing.
300
I make room for him in the sleeping bag. We lean back
against the cave wall, my head on his shoulder, his arms
wrapped around me. I can feel Haymitch nudging me to keep
up the act. So, since we were five, you never even noticed any
other girls? I ask him.
No, I noticed just about every girl, but none of them made
a lasting impression but you, he says.
I’m sure that would thrill your parents, you liking a girl
from the Seam, I say.
Hardly. But I couldn’t care less. Anyway, if we make it
back, you won’t be a girl from the Seam, you’ll be a girl from
the Victor’s Village, he says.
That’s right. If we win, we’ll each get a house in the part of
town reserved for Hunger Games’ victors. Long ago, when the
Games began, the Capitol had built a dozen fine houses in each
district. Of course, in ours only one is occupied. Most of the
others have never been lived in at all.
A disturbing thought hits me. But then, our only neighbor
will be Haymitch!
Ah, that’ll be nice, says Peeta, tightening his arms around
me. You and me and Haymitch. Very cozy. Picnics, birthdays,
long winter nights around the fire retelling old Hunger Games’
tales.
I told you, he hates me! I say, but I can’t help laughing at
the image of Haymitch becoming my new pal.
Only sometimes. When he’s sober, I’ve never heard him
say one negative thing about you, says Peeta.
He’s never sober! I protest.
301
That’s right. Who am I thinking of? Oh, I know. It’s Cinna
who likes you. But that’s mainly because you didn’t try to run
when he set you on fire, says Peeta. On the other hand,
Haymitch . . . well, if I were you, I’d avoid Haymitch completely.
He hates you.
I thought you said I was his favorite, I say.
He hates me more, says Peeta. I don’t think people in
general are his sort of thing.
I know the audience will enjoy our having fun at Haymitch’s
expense. He has been around so long, he’s practically
an old friend to some of them. And after his head-dive off the
stage at the reaping, everybody knows him. By this time,
they’ll have dragged him out of the control room for interviews
about us. No telling what sort of lies he’s made up. He’s
at something of a disadvantage because most mentors have a
partner, another victor to help them whereas Haymitch has to
be ready to go into action at any moment. Kind of like me
when I was alone in the arena. I wonder how he’s holding up,
with the drinking, the attention, and the stress of trying to
keep us alive.
It’s funny. Haymitch and I don’t get along well in person,
but maybe Peeta is right about us being alike because he
seems able to communicate with me by the timing of his gifts.
Like how I knew I must be close to water when he withheld it
and how I knew the sleep syrup just wasn’t something to ease
Peeta’s pain and how I know now that I have to play up the
romance. He hasn’t made much effort to connect with Peeta
302
really. Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would just be a bowl
of broth to Peeta, whereas I’ll see the strings attached to it.
A thought hits me, and I’m amazed the question’s taken so
long to surface. Maybe it’s because I’ve only recently begun to
view Haymitch with a degree of curiosity. How do you think
he did it?
Who? Did what? Peeta asks.
Haymitch. How do you think he won the Games? I say.
Peeta considers this quite a while before he answers. Haymitch
is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like Cato or
Thresh. He’s not particularly handsome. Not in the way that
causes sponsors to rain gifts on you. And he’s so surly, it’s
hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him. There’s only
one way Haymitch could have won, and Peeta says it just as
I’m reaching this conclusion myself.
He outsmarted the others, says Peeta.
I nod, then let the conversation drop. But secretly I’m wondering
if Haymitch sobered up long enough to help Peeta and
me because he thought we just might have the wits to survive.
Maybe he wasn’t always a drunk. Maybe, in the beginning, he
tried to help the tributes. But then it got unbearable. It must
be hell to mentor two kids and then watch them die. Year after
year after year. I realize that if I get out of here, that will become
my job. To mentor the girl from District 12. The idea is
so repellent, I thrust it from my mind.
About half an hour has passed before I decide I have to eat
again. Peeta’s too hungry himself to put up an argument.
While I’m dishing up two more small servings of lamb stew
303
and rice, we hear the anthem begin to play. Peeta presses his
eyes against a crack in the rocks to watch the sky.
There won’t be anything to see tonight, I say, far more interested
in the stew than the sky. Nothing’s happened or we
would’ve heard a cannon.
Katniss, Peeta says quietly.
What? Should we split another roll, too? I ask.
Katniss, he repeats, but I find myself wanting to ignore
him.
I’m going to split one. But I’ll save the cheese for tomorrow,
I say. I see Peeta staring at me. What?
Thresh is dead, says Peeta.
He can’t be, I say.
They must have fired the cannon during the thunder and
we missed it, says Peeta.
Are you sure? I mean, it’s pouring buckets out there. I
don’t know how you can see anything, I say. I push him away
from the rocks and squint out into the dark, rainy sky. For
about ten seconds, I catch a distorted glimpse of Thresh’s picture
and then he’s gone. Just like that.
I slump down against the rocks, momentarily forgetting
about the task at hand. Thresh dead. I should be happy, right?
One less tribute to face. And a powerful one, too. But I’m not
happy. All I can think about is Thresh letting me go, letting me
run because of Rue, who died with that spear in her stomach. .
. .
You all right? asks Peeta.
304
I give a noncommittal shrug and cup my elbows in my
hands, hugging them close to my body. I have to bury the real
pain because who’s going to bet on a tribute who keeps sniveling
over the deaths of her opponents. Rue was one thing. We
were allies. She was so young. But no one will understand my
sorrow at Thresh’s murder. The word pulls me up short. Murder!
Thankfully, I didn’t say it aloud. That’s not going to win
me any points in the arena. What I do say is, It’s just . . . if we
didn’t win . . . I wanted Thresh to. Because he let me go. And
because of Rue.
Yeah, I know, says Peeta. But this means we’re one step
closer to District Twelve. He nudges a plate of foot into my
hands. Eat. It’s still warm.
I take a bite of the stew to show I don’t really care, but it’s
like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort to swallow. It
also means Cato will be back hunting us.
And he’s got supplies again, says Peeta.
He’ll be wounded, I bet, I say.
What makes you say that? Peeta asks.
Because Thresh would have never gone down without a
fight. He’s so strong, I mean, he was. And they were in his territory,
I say.
Good, says Peeta. The more wounded Cato is the better. I
wonder how Foxface is making out.
Oh, she’s fine, I say peevishly. I’m still angry she thought
of hiding in the Cornucopia and I didn’t. Probably be easier to
catch Cato than her.
305
Maybe they’ll catch each other and we can just go home,
says Peeta. But we better be extra careful about the watches.
I dozed off a few times.
Me, too, I admit. But not tonight.
We finish our food in silence and then Peeta offers to take
the first watch. I burrow down in the sleeping bag next to him,
pulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras. I
just need a few moments of privacy where I can let any emotion
cross my face without being seen. Under the hood, I silently
say good-bye to Thresh and thank him for my life. I
promise to remember him and, if I can, do something to help
his family and Rue’s, if I win. Then I escape into sleep, comforted
by a full belly and the steady warmth of Peeta beside
me.
When Peeta wakes me later, the first thing I register is the
smell of goat cheese. He’s holding out half a roll spread with
the creamy white stuff and topped with apple slices. Don’t be
mad, he says. I had to eat again. Here’s your half.
Oh, good, I say, immediately taking a huge bite. The
strong fatty cheese tastes just like the kind Prim makes, the
apples are sweet and crunchy. Mm.
We make a goat cheese and apple tart at the bakery, he
says.
Bet that’s expensive, I say.
Too expensive for my family to eat. Unless it’s gone very
stale. Of course, practically everything we eat is stale, says
Peeta, pulling the sleeping bag up around him. In less than a
minute, he’s snoring.
306
Huh. I always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft life.
And it’s true, Peeta has always had enough to eat. But
there’s something kind of depressing about living your life on
stale bread, the hard, dry loaves that no one else wanted. One
thing about us, since I bring our food home on a daily basis,
most of it is so fresh you have to make sure it isn’t going to
make a run for it.
Somewhere during my shift, the rain stops not gradually
but all at once. The downpour ends and there’s only the residual
drippings of water from branches, the rush of the now
overflowing stream below us. A full, beautiful moon emerges,
and even without the glasses I can see outside. I can’t decide if
the moon is real or merely a projection of the Gamemakers. I
know it was full shortly before I left home. Gale and I watched
it rise as we hunted into the late hours.
How long have I been gone? I’m guessing it’s been about
two weeks in the arena, and there was that week of preparation
in the Capitol. Maybe the moon has completed its cycle.
For some reason, I badly want it to be my moon, the same one
I see from the woods around District 12. That would give me
something to cling to in the surreal world of the arena where
the authenticity of everything is to be doubted.
Four of us left.
For the first time, I allow myself to truly think about the
possibility that I might make it home. To fame. To wealth. To
my own house in the Victor’s Village. My mother and Prim
would live there with me. No more fear of hunger. A new kind
of freedom. But then . . . what? What would my life be like on a
307
daily basis? Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition
of food. Take that away and I’m not really sure who I am, what
my identity is. The idea scares me some. I think of Haymitch,
with all his money. What did his life become? He lives alone,
no wife or children, most of his waking hours drunk. I don’t
want to end up like that.
But you won’t be alone, I whisper to myself. I have my
mother and Prim. Well, for the time being. And then . . . I don’t
want to think about then, when Prim has grown up, my mother
passed away. I know I’ll never marry, never risk bringing a
child into the world. Because if there’s one thing being a victor
doesn’t guarantee, it’s your children’s safety. My kids’ names
would go right into the reaping balls with everyone else’s. And
I swear I’ll never let that happen.
The sun eventually rises, its light slipping through the
cracks and illuminating Peeta’s face. Who will he transform into
if we make it home? This perplexing, good-natured boy who
can spin out lies so convincingly the whole of Panem believes
him to be hopelessly in love with me, and I’ll admit it, there
are moments when he makes me believe it myself? At least,
we’ll be friends, I think. Nothing will change the fact that we’ve
saved each other’s lives in here. And beyond that, he will always
be the boy with the bread. Good friends. Anything
beyond that though . . . and I feel Gale’s gray eyes watching me
watching Peeta, all the way from District 12.
Discomfort causes me to move. I scoot over and shake Peeta’s
shoulder. His eyes open sleepily and when they focus on
me, he pulls me down for a long kiss.
308
We’re wasting hunting time, I say when I finally break
away.
I wouldn’t call it wasting, he says giving a big stretch as
he sits up. So do we hunt on empty stomachs to give us an
edge?
Not us, I say. We stuff ourselves to give us staying power.
Count me in, Peeta says. But I can see he’s surprised when
I divide the rest of the stew and rice and hand a heaping plate
to him. All this?
We’ll earn it back today, I say, and we both plow into our
plates. Even cold, it’s one of the best things I’ve ever tasted. I
abandon my fork and scrape up the last dabs of gravy with my
finger. I can feel Effie Trinket shuddering at my manners.
Hey, Effie, watch this! says Peeta. He tosses his fork over
his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue
making loud, satisfied sounds. Then he blows a kiss out to her
in general and calls, We miss you, Effie!
I cover his mouth with my hand, but I’m laughing. Stop!
Cato could be right outside our cave.
He grabs my hand away. What do I care? I’ve got you to
protect me now, says Peeta, pulling me to him.
Come on, I say in exasperation, extricating myself from
his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss.
Once we’re packed up and standing outside our cave, our
mood shifts to serious. It’s as though for the last few days,
sheltered by the rocks and the rain and Cato’s preoccupation
with Thresh, we were given a respite, a holiday of sorts. Now,
309
although the day is sunny and warm, we both sense we’re really
back in the Games. I hand Peeta my knife, since whatever
weapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it into his
belt. My last seven arrows — of the twelve I sacrificed three in
the explosion, two at the feast — rattle a bit too loosely in the
quiver. I can’t afford to lose any more.
He’ll be hunting us by now, says Peeta. Cato isn’t one to
wait for his prey to wander by.
If he’s wounded — I begin.
It won’t matter, Peeta breaks in. If he can move, he’s
coming.
With all the rain, the stream has overrun its banks by several
feet on either side. We stop there to replenish our water. I
check the snares I set days ago and come up empty. Not surprising
with the weather. Besides, I haven’t seen many animals
or signs of them in this area.
If we want food, we better head back up to my old hunting
grounds,
 I say.
Your call. Just tell me what you need me to do, Peeta says.
Keep an eye out, I say. Stay on the rocks as much as possible,
no sense in leaving him tracks to follow. And listen for
both of us. It’s clear, at this point, that the explosion destroyed
the hearing in my left ear for good.
I’d walk in the water to cover our tracks completely, but I’m
not sure Peeta’s leg could take the current. Although the drugs
have erased the infection, he’s still pretty weak. My forehead
hurts along the knife cut, but after three days the bleeding has
310
stopped. I wear a bandage around my head though, just in
case physical exertion should bring it back.
As we head up alongside the stream, we pass the place
where I found Peeta camouflaged in the weeds and mud. One
good thing, between the downpour and the flooded banks, all
signs of his hiding place have been wiped out. That means
that, if need be, we can come back to our cave. Otherwise, I
wouldn’t risk it with Cato after us.
The boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn to pebbles,
and then, to my relief, we’re back on pine needles and the
gentle incline of the forest floor. For the first time, I realize we
have a problem. Navigating the rocky terrain with a bad leg —
well, you’re naturally going to make some noise. But even on
the smooth bed of needles, Peeta is loud. And I mean loud
loud, as if he’s stomping his feet or something. I turn and look
at him.
What? he asks.
You’ve got to move more quietly, I say. Forget about Cato,
you’re chasing off every rabbit in a ten-mile radius.
Really? he says. Sorry, I didn’t know.
So, we start up again and he’s a tiny bit better, but even
with only one working ear, he’s making me jump.
Can you take your boots off? I suggest.
Here? he asks in disbelief, as if I’d asked him to walk barefoot
on hot coals or something. I have to remind myself that
he’s still not used to the woods, that it’s the scary, forbidden
place beyond the fences of District 12. I think of Gale, with his
velvet tread. It’s eerie how little sound he makes, even when
311
the leaves have fallen and it’s a challenge to move at all without
chasing off the game. I feel certain he’s laughing back
home.
Yes, I say patiently. I will, too. That way we’ll both be
quieter. Like I was making any noise. So we both strip off our
boots and socks and, while there’s some improvement, I could
swear he’s making an effort to snap every branch we encounter.
Needless to say, although it takes several hours to reach my
old camp with Rue, I’ve shot nothing. If the stream would settle
down, fish might be an option, but the current is still too
strong. As we stop to rest and drink water, I try to work out a
solution. Ideally, I’d dump Peeta now with some simple rootgathering
chore and go hunt, but then he’d be left with only a
knife to defend himself against Cato’s spears and superior
strength. So what I’d really like is to try and conceal him
somewhere safe, then go hunt, and come back and collect him.
But I have a feeling his ego isn’t going to go for that suggestion.
Katniss, he says. We need to split up. I know I’m chasing
away the game.
Only because your leg’s hurt, I say generously, because
really, you can tell that’s only a small part of the problem.
I know, he says. So, why don’t you go on? Show me some
plants to gather and that way we’ll both be useful.
Not if Cato comes and kills you. I tried to say it in a nice
way, but it still sounds like I think he’s a weakling.
312
Surprisingly, he just laughs. Look, I can handle Cato. I
fought him before, didn’t I?
Yeah, and that turned out great. You ended up dying in a
mud bank. That’s what I want to say, but I can’t. He did save
my life by taking on Cato after all. I try another tactic. What if
you climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while I
hunted? I say, trying to make it sound like very important
work.
What if you show me what’s edible around here and go get
us some meat? he says, mimicking my tone. Just don’t go far,
in case you need help.
I sigh and show him some roots to dig. We do need food, no
question. One apple, two rolls, and a blob of cheese the size of
a plum won’t last long. I’ll just go a short distance and hope
Cato is a long way off.
I teach him a bird whistle — not a melody like Rue’s but a
simple two-note whistle — which we can use to communicate
that we’re all right. Fortunately, he’s good at this. Leaving him
with the pack, I head off.
I feel like I’m eleven again, tethered not to the safety of the
fence but to Peeta, allowing myself twenty, maybe thirty yards
of hunting space. Away from him though, the woods come
alive with animal sounds. Reassured by his periodic whistles, I
allow myself to drift farther away, and soon have two rabbits
and a fat squirrel to show for it. I decide it’s enough. I can set
snares and maybe get some fish. With Peeta’s roots, this will
be enough for now.
313
As I travel the short distance back, I realize we haven’t exchanged
signals in a while. When my whistle receives no response,
I run. In no time, I find the pack, a neat pile of roots
beside it. The sheet of plastic has been laid on the ground
where the sun can reach the single layer of berries that covers
it. But where is he?
Peeta! I call out in a panic. Peeta! I turn to the rustle of
brush and almost send an arrow through him. Fortunately, I
pull my bow at the last second and it sticks in an oak trunk to
his left. He jumps back, flinging a handful of berries into the
foliage.
My fear comes out as anger. What are you doing? You’re
supposed to be here, not running around in the woods!
I found some berries down by the stream, he says, clearly
confused by my outburst.
I whistled. Why didn’t you whistle back? I snap at him.
I didn’t hear. The water’s too loud, I guess, he says. He
crosses and puts his hands on my shoulders. That’s when I
feel that I’m trembling.
I thought Cato killed you! I almost shout.
No, I’m fine. Peeta wraps his arms around me, but I don’t
respond. Katniss?
I push away, trying to sort out my feelings. If two people
agree on a signal, they stay in range. Because if one of them
doesn’t answer, they’re in trouble, all right?
All right! he says.
All right. Because that’s what happened with Rue, and I
watched her die! I say. I turn away from him, go to the pack
314
and open a fresh bottle of water, although I still have some in
mine. But I’m not ready to forgive him. I notice the food. The
rolls and apples are untouched, but someone’s definitely
picked away part of the cheese. And you ate without me! I
really don’t care, I just want something else to be mad about.
What? No, I didn’t, Peeta says.
Oh, and I suppose the apples ate the cheese, I say.
I don’t know what ate the cheese, Peeta says slowly and
distinctly, as if trying not to lose his temper, but it wasn’t me.
I’ve been down by the stream collecting berries. Would you
care for some?
I would actually, but I don’t want to relent too soon. I do
walk over and look at them. I’ve never seen this type before.
No, I have. But not in the arena. These aren’t Rue’s berries, although
they resemble them. Nor do they match any I learned
about in training. I lean down and scoop up a few, rolling them
between my fingers.
My father’s voice comes back to me. Not these, Katniss.
Never these. They’re nightlock. You’ll be dead before they
reach your stomach.
Just then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting Peeta
to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The
hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away. What’s left of
Foxface’s emaciated body is lifted into the air. I can see the red
glint of her hair in the sunlight.
I should have known the moment I saw the missing cheese.
. . .
315
Peeta has me by the arm, pushing me toward a tree. Climb.
He’ll be here in a second. We’ll stand a better chance fighting
him from above.
I stop him, suddenly calm. No, Peeta, she’s your kill, not
Cato’s.
What? I haven’t even seen her since the first day, he says.
How could I have killed her?
In answer, I hold out the berries.
316
It takes a while to explain the situation to Peeta. How Foxface
stole the food from the supply pile before I blew it up,
how she tried to take enough to stay alive but not enough that
anyone would notice it, how she wouldn’t question the safety
of berries we were preparing to eat ourselves.
I wonder how she found us, says Peeta. My fault, I guess,
if I’m as loud as you say.
We were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle, but I try
to be kind. And she’s very clever, Peeta. Well, she was. Until
you outfoxed her.
Not on purpose. Doesn’t seem fair somehow. I mean, we
would have both been dead, too, if she hadn’t eaten the berries
first. He checks himself. No, of course, we wouldn’t. You
recognized them, didn’t you?
I give a nod. We call them nightlock.
Even the name sounds deadly, he says. I’m sorry, Katniss.
I really thought they were the same ones you’d gathered.
Don’t apologize. It just means we’re one step closer to
home, right? I ask.
I’ll get rid of the rest, Peeta says. He gathers up the sheet
of blue plastic, careful to trap the berries inside, and goes to
toss them into the woods.
317
Wait! I cry. I find the leather pouch that belonged to the
boy from District 1 and fill it with a few handfuls of berries
from the plastic. If they fooled Foxface, maybe they can fool
Cato as well. If he’s chasing us or something, we can act like
we accidentally drop the pouch and if he eats them —
Then hello District Twelve, says Peeta.
That’s it, I say, securing the pouch to my belt.
He’ll know where we are now, says Peeta. If he was anywhere
nearby and saw that hovercraft, he’ll know we killed
her and come after us.
Peeta’s right. This could be just the opportunity Cato’s been
waiting for. But even if we run now, there’s the meat to cook
and our fire will be another sign of our whereabouts. Let’s
make a fire. Right now. I begin to gather branches and brush.
Are you ready to face him? Peeta asks.
I’m ready to eat. Better to cook our food while we have the
chance. If he knows we’re here, he knows. But he also knows
there’s two of us and probably assumes we were hunting Foxface.
That means you’re recovered. And the fire means we’re
not hiding, we’re inviting him here. Would you show up? I
ask.
Maybe not, he says.
Peeta’s a whiz with fires, coaxing a blaze out of the damp
wood. In no time, I have the rabbits and squirrel roasting, the
roots, wrapped in leaves, baking in the coals. We take turns
gathering greens and keeping a careful watch for Cato, but as I
anticipated, he doesn’t make an appearance.
318
When the food’s cooked, I pack most of it up, leaving us
each a rabbit’s leg to eat as we walk.
I want to move higher into the woods, climb a good tree,
and make camp for the night, but Peeta resists. I can’t climb
like you, Katniss, especially with my leg, and I don’t think I
could ever fall asleep fifty feet above the ground.
It’s not safe to stay in the open, Peeta, I say.
Can’t we go back to the cave? he asks. It’s near water and
easy to defend.
I sigh. Several more hours of walking — or should I say
crashing — through the woods to reach an area we’ll just have
to leave in the morning to hunt. But Peeta doesn’t ask for
much. He’s followed my instructions all day and I’m sure if
things were reversed, he wouldn’t make me spend the night in
a tree. It dawns on me that I haven’t been very nice to Peeta
today. Nagging him about how loud he was, screaming at him
over disappearing. The playful romance we had sustained in
the cave has disappeared out in the open, under the hot sun,
with the threat of Cato looming over us. Haymitch has probably
just about had it with me. And as for the audience . . .
I reach up and give him a kiss. Sure. Let’s go back to the
cave.
He looks pleased and relieved. Well, that was easy.
I work my arrow out of the oak, careful not to damage the
shaft. These arrows are food, safety, and life itself now.
We toss a bunch more wood on the fire. It should be sending
off smoke for a few more hours, although I doubt Cato assumes
anything at this point. When we reach the stream, I see
319
the water has dropped considerably and moves at its old leisurely
pace, so I suggest we walk back in it. Peeta’s happy to
oblige and since he’s a lot quieter in water than on land, it’s a
doubly good idea. It’s a long walk back to the cave though,
even going downward, even with the rabbit to give us a boost.
We’re both exhausted by our hike today and still way too underfed.
I keep my bow loaded, both for Cato and any fish I
might see, but the stream seems strangely empty of creatures.
By the time we reach our destination, our feet are dragging
and the sun sits low on the horizon. We fill up our water bottles
and climb the little slope to our den. It’s not much, but out
here in the wilderness, it’s the closest thing we have to a
home. It will be warmer than a tree, too, because it provides
some shelter from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in
from the west. I set a good dinner out, but halfway through
Peeta begins to nod off. After days of inactivity, the hunt has
taken its toll. I order him into the sleeping bag and set aside
the rest of his food for when he wakes. He drops off immediately.
I pull the sleeping bag up to his chin and kiss his forehead,
not for the audience, but for me. Because I’m so grateful
that he’s still here, not dead by the stream as I’d thought. So
glad that I don’t have to face Cato alone.
Brutal, bloody Cato who can snap a neck with a twist of his
arm, who had the power to overcome Thresh, who has had it
out for me since the beginning. He probably has had a special
hatred for me ever since I outscored him in training. A boy
like Peeta would simply shrug that off. But I have a feeling it
drove Cato to distraction. Which is not that hard. I think of his
320
ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown up. The others
were upset, of course, but he was completely unhinged. I
wonder now if Cato might not be entirely sane.
The sky lights up with the seal, and I watch Foxface shine in
the sky and then disappear from the world forever. He hasn’t
said it, but I don’t think Peeta felt good about killing her, even
if it was essential. I can’t pretend I’ll miss her, but I have to
admire her. My guess is if they had given us some sort of test,
she would have been the smartest of all the tributes. If, in fact,
we had been setting a trap for her, I bet she’d have sensed it
and avoided the berries. It was Peeta’s own ignorance that
brought her down. I’ve spent so much time making sure I
don’t underestimate my opponents that I’ve forgotten it’s just
as dangerous to overestimate them as well.
That brings me back to Cato. But while I think I had a sense
of Foxface, who she was and how she operated, he’s a little
more slippery. Powerful, well trained, but smart? I don’t
know. Not like she was. And utterly lacking in the control Foxface
demonstrated. I believe Cato could easily lose his judgment
in a fit of temper. Not that I can feel superior on that
point. I think of the moment I sent the arrow flying into the
apple in the pig’s mouth when I was so enraged. Maybe I do
understand Cato better than I think.
Despite the fatigue in my body, my mind’s alert, so I let Peeta
sleep long past our usual switch. In fact, a soft gray day has
begun when I shake his shoulder. He looks out, almost in
alarm. I slept the whole night. That’s not fair, Katniss, you
should have woken me.
321
I stretch and burrow down into the bag. I’ll sleep now.
Wake me if anything interesting happens.
Apparently nothing does, because when I open my eyes,
bright hot afternoon light gleams through the rocks. Any sign
of our friend? I ask.
Peeta shakes his head. No, he’s keeping a disturbingly low
profile.
How long do you think we’ll have before the Gamemakers
drive us together? I ask.
Well, Foxface died almost a day ago, so there’s been plenty
of time for the audience to place bets and get bored. I guess it
could happen at any moment, says Peeta.
Yeah, I have a feeling today’s the day, I say. I sit up and
look out at the peaceful terrain. I wonder how they’ll do it.
Peeta remains silent. There’s not really any good answer.
Well, until they do, no sense in wasting a hunting day. But
we should probably eat as much as we can hold just in case we
run into trouble, I say.
Peeta packs up our gear while I lay out a big meal. The rest
of the rabbits, roots, greens, the rolls spread with the last bit
of cheese. The only thing I leave in reserve is the squirrel and
the apple.
By the time we’re done, all that’s left is a pile of rabbit
bones. My hands are greasy, which only adds to my growing
feeling of grubbiness. Maybe we don’t bathe daily in the Seam,
but we keep cleaner than I have of late. Except for my feet,
which have walked in the stream, I’m covered in a layer of
grime.
322
Leaving the cave has a sense of finality about it. I don’t
think there will be another night in the arena somehow. One
way or the other, dead or alive, I have the feeling I’ll escape it
today. I give the rocks a pat good-bye and we head down to
the stream to wash up. I can feel my skin, itching for the cool
water. I may do my hair and braid it back wet. I’m wondering
if we might even be able to give our clothes a quick scrub
when we reach the stream. Or what used to be the stream.
Now there’s only a bone-dry bed. I put my hand down to feel
it.
Not even a little damp. They must have drained it while we
slept, I say. A fear of the cracked tongue, aching body and
fuzzy mind brought on by my previous dehydration creeps into
my consciousness. Our bottles and skin are fairly full, but
with two drinking and this hot sun it won’t take long to deplete
them.
The lake, says Peeta. That’s where they want us to go.
Maybe the ponds still have some, I say hopefully.
We can check, he says, but he’s just humoring me. I’m
humoring myself because I know what I’ll find when we return
to the pond where I soaked my leg. A dusty, gaping
mouth of a hole. But we make the trip anyway just to confirm
what we already know.
You’re right. They’re driving us to the lake, I say. Where
there’s no cover. Where they’re guaranteed a bloody fight to
the death with nothing to block their view. Do you want to go
straightaway or wait until the water’s tapped out?
323
Let’s go now, while we’ve had food and rest. Let’s just go
end this thing, he says.
I nod. It’s funny. I feel almost as if it’s the first day of the
Games again. That I’m in the same position. Twenty-one tributes
are dead, but I still have yet to kill Cato. And really,
wasn’t he always the one to kill? Now it seems the other tributes
were just minor obstacles, distractions, keeping us from
the real battle of the Games. Cato and me.
But no, there’s the boy waiting beside me. I feel his arms
wrap around me.
Two against one. Should be a piece of cake, he says.
Next time we eat, it will be in the Capitol, I answer.
You bet it will, he says.
We stand there a while, locked in an embrace, feeling each
other, the sunlight, the rustle of the leaves at our feet. Then
without a word, we break apart and head for the lake.
I don’t care now that Peeta’s footfalls send rodents scurrying,
make birds take wing. We have to fight Cato and I’d just as
soon do it here as on the plain. But I doubt I’ll have that
choice. If the Gamemakers want us in the open, then in the
open we will be.
We stop to rest for a few moments under the tree where
the Careers trapped me. The husk of the tracker jacker nest,
beaten to a pulp by the heavy rains and dried in the burning
sun, confirms the location. I touch it with the tip of my boot,
and it dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the
breeze. I can’t help looking up in the tree where Rue secretly
324
perched, waiting to save my life. Tracker jackers. Glimmer’s
bloated body. The terrifying hallucinations . . .
Let’s move on, I say, wanting to escape the darkness that
surrounds this place. Peeta doesn’t object.
Given our late start to the day, when we reach the plain it’s
already early evening. There’s no sign of Cato. No sign of anything
except the gold Cornucopia glowing in the slanting sun
rays. Just in case Cato decided to pull a Foxface on us, we circle
the Cornucopia to make sure it’s empty. Then obediently,
as if following instructions, we cross to the lake and fill our
water containers.
I frown at the shrinking sun. We don’t want to fight him after
dark. There’s only the one pair of glasses.
Peeta carefully squeezes drops of iodine into the water.
Maybe that’s what he’s waiting for. What do you want to do?
Go back to the cave?
Either that or find a tree. But let’s give him another half an
hour or so. Then we’ll take cover, I answer.
We sit by the lake, in full sight. There’s no point in hiding
now. In the trees at the edge of the plain, I can see the mockingjays
flitting about. Bouncing melodies back and forth between
them like brightly colored balls. I open my mouth and
sing out Rue’s four-note run. I can feel them pause curiously at
the sound of my voice, listening for more. I repeat the notes in
the silence. First one mockingjay trills the tune back, then
another. Then the whole world comes alive with the sound.
Just like your father, says Peeta.
325
My fingers find the pin on my shirt. That’s Rue’s song, I
say. I think they remember it.
The music swells and I recognize the brilliance of it. As the
notes overlap, they compliment one another, forming a lovely,
unearthly harmony. It was this sound then, thanks to Rue, that
sent the orchard workers of District 11 home each night. Does
someone start it at quitting time, I wonder, now that she is
dead?
For a while, I just close my eyes and listen, mesmerized by
the beauty of the song. Then something begins to disrupt the
music. Runs cut off in jagged, imperfect lines. Dissonant notes
intersperse with the melody. The mockingjays’ voices rise up
in a shrieking cry of alarm.
We’re on our feet, Peeta wielding his knife, me poised to
shoot, when Cato smashes through the trees and bears down
on us. He has no spear. In fact, his hands are empty, yet he
runs straight for us. My first arrow hits his chest and inexplicably
falls aside.
He’s got some kind of body armor! I shout to Peeta.
Just in time, too, because Cato is upon us. I brace myself,
but he rockets right between us with no attempt to check his
speed. I can tell from his panting, the sweat pouring off his
purplish face, that he’s been running hard a long time. Not toward
us. From something. But what?
My eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first creature
leap onto the plain. As I’m turning away, I see another half
dozen join it. Then I am stumbling blindly after Cato with no
thought of anything but to save myself.
326
Muttations. No question about it. I’ve never seen these
mutts, but they’re no natural-born animals. They resemble
huge wolves, but what wolf lands and then balances easily on
its hind legs? What wolf waves the rest of the pack forward
with its front paw as though it had a wrist? These things I can
see at a distance. Up close, I’m sure their more menacing
attributes will be revealed.
Cato has made a beeline for the Cornucopia, and without
question I follow him. If he thinks it’s the safest place, who am
I to argue? Besides, even if I could make it to the trees, it
would be impossible for Peeta to outrun them on that leg —
Peeta! My hands have just landed on the metal at the pointed
tail of the Cornucopia when I remember I’m part of a team.
He’s about fifteen yards behind me, hobbling as fast as he can,
but the mutts are closing in on him fast. I send an arrow into
the pack and one goes down, but there are plenty to take its
place.
Peeta’s waving me up the horn, Go, Katniss! Go!
He’s right. I can’t protect either of us on the ground. I start
climbing, scaling the Cornucopia on my hands and feet. The
pure gold surface has been designed to resemble the woven
horn that we fill at harvest, so there are little ridges and seams
327
to get a decent hold on. But after a day in the arena sun, the
metal feels hot enough to blister my hands.
Cato lies on his side at the very top of the horn, twenty feet
above the ground, gasping to catch his breath as he gags over
the edge. Now’s my chance to finish him off. I stop midway up
the horn and load another arrow, but just as I’m about to let it
fly, I hear Peeta cry out. I twist around and see he’s just
reached the tail, and the mutts are right on his heels.
Climb! I yell. Peeta starts up hampered by not only the leg
but the knife in his hand. I shoot my arrow down the throat of
the first mutt that places its paws on the metal. As it dies the
creature lashes out, inadvertently opening gashes on a few of
its companions. That’s when I get a look at the claws. Four
inches and clearly razor-sharp.
Peeta reaches my feet and I grab his arm and pull him
along. Then I remember Cato waiting at the top and whip
around, but he’s doubled over with cramps and apparently
more preoccupied with the mutts than us. He coughs out
something unintelligible. The snuffling, growling sound coming
from the mutts isn’t helping.
What? I shout at him.
He said, ‘Can they climb it?’ answers Peeta, drawing my
focus back to the base of the horn.
The mutts are beginning to assemble. As they join together,
they raise up again to stand easily on their back legs giving
them an eerily human quality. Each has a thick coat, some
with fur that is straight and sleek, others curly, and the colors
vary from jet black to what I can only describe as blond.
328
There’s something else about them, something that makes the
hair rise up on the back of my neck, but I can’t put my finger
on it.
They put their snouts on the horn, sniffing and tasting the
metal, scraping paws over the surface and then making highpitched
yipping sounds to one another. This must be how they
communicate because the pack backs up as if to make room.
Then one of them, a good-size mutt with silky waves of blond
fur takes a running start and leaps onto the horn. Its back legs
must be incredibly powerful because it lands a mere ten feet
below us, its pink lips pulled back in a snarl. For a moment it
hangs there, and in that moment I realize what else unsettled
me about the mutts. The green eyes glowering at me are unlike
any dog or wolf, any canine I’ve ever seen. They are unmistakably
human. And that revelation has barely registered
when I notice the collar with the number 1 inlaid with jewels
and the whole horrible thing hits me. The blonde hair, the
green eyes, the number . . . it’s Glimmer.
A shriek escapes my lips and I’m having trouble holding the
arrow in place. I have been waiting to fire, only too aware of
my dwindling supply of arrows. Waiting to see if the creatures
can, in fact, climb. But now, even though the mutt has begun to
slide backward, unable to find any purchase on the metal,
even though I can hear the slow screeching of the claws like
nails on a blackboard, I fire into its throat. Its body twitches
and flops onto the ground with a thud.
Katniss? I can feel Peeta’s grip on my arm.
It’s her! I get out.
329
Who? asks Peeta.
My head snaps from side to side as I examine the pack, taking
in the various sizes and colors. The small one with the red
coat and amber eyes . . . Foxface! And there, the ashen hair and
hazel eyes of the boy from District 9 who died as we struggled
for the backpack! And worst of all, the smallest mutt, with
dark glossy fur, huge brown eyes and a collar that reads 11 in
woven straw. Teeth bared in hatred. Rue . . .
What is it, Katniss? Peeta shakes my shoulder.
It’s them. It’s all of them. The others. Rue and Foxface and .
. . all of the other tributes, I choke out.
I hear Peeta’s gasp of recognition. What did they do to
them? You don’t think . . . those could be their real eyes?
Their eyes are the least of my worries. What about their
brains? Have they been given any of the real tributes memories?
Have they been programmed to hate our faces particularly
because we have survived and they were so callously
murdered? And the ones we actually killed . . . do they believe
they’re avenging their own deaths?
Before I can get this out, the mutts begin a new assault on
the horn. They’ve split into two groups at the sides of the horn
and are using those powerful hindquarters to launch themselves
at us. A pair of teeth ring together just inches from my
hand and then I hear Peeta cry out, feel the yank on his body,
the heavy weight of boy and mutt pulling me over the side. If
not for the grip on my arm, he’d be on the ground, but as it is,
it takes all my strength to keep us both on the curved back of
the horn. And more tributes are coming.
330
Kill it, Peeta! Kill it! I’m shouting, and although I can’t
quite see what’s happening, I know he must have stabbed the
thing because the pull lessens. I’m able to haul him back onto
the horn where we drag ourselves toward the top where the
lesser of two evils awaits.
Cato has still not regained his feet, but his breathing is
slowing and I know soon he’ll be recovered enough to come
for us, to hurl us over the side to our deaths. I arm my bow,
but the arrow ends up taking out a mutt that can only be
Thresh. Who else could jump so high? I feel a moment’s relief
because we must finally be up above the mutt line and I’m just
turning back to face Cato when Peeta’s jerked from my side.
I’m sure the pack has got him until his blood splatters my face.
Cato stands before me, almost at the lip of the horn, holding
Peeta in some kind of headlock, cutting off his air. Peeta’s
clawing at Cato’s arm, but weakly, as if confused over whether
it’s more important to breathe or try and stem the gush of
blood from the gaping hole a mutt left in his calf.
I aim one of my last two arrows at Cato’s head, knowing it’ll
have no effect on his trunk or limbs, which I can now see are
clothed in a skintight, flesh-colored mesh. Some high-grade
body armor from the Capitol. Was that what was in his pack at
the feast? Body armor to defend against my arrows? Well,
they neglected to send a face guard.
Cato just laughs. Shoot me and he goes down with me.
He’s right. If I take him out and he falls to the mutts, Peeta
is sure to die with him. We’ve reached a stalemate. I can’t
shoot Cato without killing Peeta, too. He can’t kill Peeta with-
331
out guaranteeing an arrow in his brain. We stand like statues,
both of us seeking an out.
My muscles are strained so tightly, they feel they might
snap at any moment. My teeth clenched to the breaking point.
The mutts go silent and the only thing I can hear is the blood
pounding in my good ear.
Peeta’s lips are turning blue. If I don’t do something quickly,
he’ll die of asphyxiation and then I’ll have lost him and Cato
will probably use his body as a weapon against me. In fact, I’m
sure this is Cato’s plan because while he’s stopped laughing,
his lips are set in a triumphant smile.
As if in a last-ditch effort, Peeta raises his fingers, dripping
with blood from his leg, up to Cato’s arm. Instead of trying to
wrestle his way free, his forefinger veers off and makes a deliberate
X on the back of Cato’s hand. Cato realizes what it
means exactly one second after I do. I can tell by the way the
smile drops from his lips. But it’s one second too late because,
by that time, my arrow is piercing his hand. He cries out and
reflexively releases Peeta who slams back against him. For a
horrible moment, I think they’re both going over. I dive forward
just catching hold of Peeta as Cato loses his footing on
the blood-slick horn and plummets to the ground.
We hear him hit, the air leaving his body on impact, and
then the mutts attack him. Peeta and I hold on to each other,
waiting for the cannon, waiting for the competition to finish,
waiting to be released. But it doesn’t happen. Not yet. Because
this is the climax of the Hunger Games, and the audience expects
a show.
332
I don’t watch, but I can hear the snarls, the growls, the
howls of pain from both human and beast as Cato takes on the
mutt pack. I can’t understand how he can be surviving until I
remember the body armor protecting him from ankle to neck
and I realize what a long night this could be. Cato must have a
knife or sword or something, too, something he had hidden in
his clothes, because on occasion there’s the death scream of a
mutt or the sound of metal on metal as the blade collides with
the golden horn. The combat moves around the side of the
Cornucopia, and I know Cato must be attempting the one maneuver
that could save his life — to make his way back around
to the tail of the horn and rejoin us. But in the end, despite his
remarkable strength and skill, he is simply overpowered.
I don’t know how long it has been, maybe an hour or so,
when Cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts dragging
him, dragging him back into the Cornucopia. Now they’ll finish
him off, I think. But there’s still no cannon.
Night falls and the anthem plays and there’s no picture of
Cato in the sky, only the faint moans coming through the metal
beneath us. The icy air blowing across the plain reminds me
that the Games are not over and may not be for who knows
how long, and there is still no guarantee of victory.
I turn my attention to Peeta and discover his leg is bleeding
as badly as ever. All our supplies, our packs, remain down by
the lake where we abandoned them when we fled from the
mutts. I have no bandage, nothing to staunch the flow of blood
from his calf. Although I’m shaking in the biting wind, I rip off
my jacket, remove my shirt, and zip back into the jacket as
333
swiftly as possible. That brief exposure sets my teeth chattering
beyond control.
Peeta’s face is gray in the pale moonlight. I make him lie
down before I probe his wound. Warm, slippery blood runs
over my fingers. A bandage will not be enough. I’ve seen my
mother tie a tourniquet a handful of times and try to replicate
it. I cut free a sleeve from my shirt, wrap it twice around his
leg just under his knee, and tie a half knot. I don’t have a stick,
so I take my remaining arrow and insert it in the knot, twisting
it as tightly as I dare. It’s risky business — Peeta may end
up losing his leg — but when I weigh this against him losing
his life, what alternative do I have? I bandage the wound in
the rest of my shirt and lay down with him.
Don’t go to sleep, I tell him. I’m not sure if this is exactly
medical protocol, but I’m terrified that if he drifts off he’ll
never wake again.
Are you cold? he asks. He unzips his jacket and I press
against him as he fastens it around me. It’s a bit warmer, sharing
our body heat inside my double layer of jackets, but the
night is young. The temperature will continue to drop.
Even now I can feel the Cornucopia, which burned so when
I first climbed it, slowly turning to ice.
Cato may win this thing yet, I whisper to Peeta.
Don’t you believe it, he says, pulling up my hood, but he’s
shaking harder than I am.
The next hours are the worst in my life, which if you think
about it, is saying something. The cold would be torture
enough, but the real nightmare is listening to Cato, moaning,
334
begging, and finally just whimpering as the mutts work away
at him. After a very short time, I don’t care who he is or what
he’s done, all I want is for his suffering to end.
Why don’t they just kill him? I ask Peeta.
You know why, he says, and pulls me closer to him.
And I do. No viewer could turn away from the show now.
From the Gamemakers’ point of view, this is the final word in
entertainment.
It goes on and on and on and eventually completely consumes
my mind, blocking out memories and hopes of tomorrow,
erasing everything but the present, which I begin to believe
will never change. There will never be anything but cold
and fear and the agonized sounds of the boy dying in the horn.
Peeta begins to doze off now, and each time he does, I find
myself yelling his name louder and louder because if he goes
and dies on me now, I know I’ll go completely insane. He’s
fighting it, probably more for me than for him, and it’s hard
because unconsciousness would be its own form of escape.
But the adrenaline pumping through my body would never allow
me to follow him, so I can’t let him go. I just can’t.
The only indication of the passage of time lies in the heavens,
the subtle shift of the moon. So Peeta begins pointing it
out to me, insisting I acknowledge its progress and sometimes,
for just a moment I feel a flicker of hope before the agony of
the night engulfs me again.
Finally, I hear him whisper that the sun is rising. I open my
eyes and find the stars fading in the pale light of dawn. I can
see, too, how bloodless Peeta’s face has become. How little
335
time he has left. And I know I have to get him back to the Capitol.
Still, no cannon has fired. I press my good ear against the
horn and can just make out Cato’s voice.
I think he’s closer now. Katniss, can you shoot him? Peeta
asks.
If he’s near the mouth, I may be able to take him out. It
would be an act of mercy at this point.
My last arrow’s in your tourniquet, I say.
Make it count, says Peeta, unzipping his jacket, letting me
loose.
So I free the arrow, tying the tourniquet back as tightly as
my frozen fingers can manage. I rub my hands together, trying
to regain circulation. When I crawl to the lip of the horn and
hang over the edge, I feel Peeta’s hands grip me for support.
It takes a few moments to find Cato in the dim light, in the
blood. Then the raw hunk of meat that used to be my enemy
makes a sound, and I know where his mouth is. And I think
the word he’s trying to say is please.
Pity, not vengeance, sends my arrow flying into his skull.
Peeta pulls me back up, bow in hand, quiver empty.
Did you get him? he whispers.
The cannon fires in answer.
Then we won, Katniss, he says hollowly.
Hurray for us, I get out, but there’s no joy of victory in my
voice.
336
A hole opens in the plain and as if on cue, the remaining
mutts bound into it, disappearing as the earth closes above
them.
We wait, for the hovercraft to take Cato’s remains, for the
trumpets of victory that should follow, but nothing happens.
Hey! I shout into air. What’s going on? The only response
is the chatter of waking birds.
Maybe it’s the body. Maybe we have to move away from
it, says Peeta.
I try to remember. Do you have to distance yourself from
the dead tribute on the final kill? My brain is too muddled to
be sure, but what else could be the reason for the delay?
Okay. Think you could make it to the lake? I ask.
Think I better try, says Peeta. We inch down to the tail of
the horn and fall to the ground. If the stiffness in my limbs is
this bad, how can Peeta even move? I rise first, swinging and
bending my arms and legs until I think I can help him up.
Somehow, we make it back to the lake. I scoop up a handful of
the cold water for Peeta and bring a second to my lips.
A mockingjay gives the long, low whistle, and tears of relief
fill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and takes Cato’s body
away. Now they will take us. Now we can go home.
But again there’s no response.
What are they waiting for? says Peeta weakly. Between
the loss of the tourniquet and the effort it took to get to the
lake, his wound has opened up again.
I don’t know, I say. Whatever the holdup is, I can’t watch
him lose any more blood. I get up to find a stick but almost
337
immediately come across the arrow that bounced off Cato’s
body armor. It will do as well as the other arrow. As I stoop to
pick it up, Claudius Templesmith’s voice booms into the arena.
Greetings to the final contestants of the Seventy-fourth
Hunger Games. The earlier revision has been revoked. Closer
examination of the rule book has disclosed that only one winner
may be allowed, he says. Good luck and may the odds be
ever in your favor.
There’s a small burst of static and then nothing more. I
stare at Peeta in disbelief as the truth sinks in. They never intended
to let us both live. This has all been devised by the Gamemakers
to guarantee the most dramatic showdown in history.
And like a fool, I bought into it.
If you think about it, it’s not that surprising, he says softly.
I watch as he painfully makes it to his feet. Then he’s moving
toward me, as if in slow motion, his hand is pulling the knife
from his belt —
Before I am even aware of my actions, my bow is loaded
with the arrow pointed straight at his heart. Peeta raises his
eyebrows and I see the knife has already left his hand on its
way to the lake where it splashes in the water. I drop my weapons
and take a step back, my face burning in what can only
be shame.
No, he says. Do it. Peeta limps toward me and thrusts
the weapons back in my hands.
I can’t, I say. I won’t.
Do it. Before they send those mutts back or something. I
don’t want to die like Cato, he says.
338
Then you shoot me, I say furiously, shoving the weapons
back at him. You shoot me and go home and live with it! And
as I say it, I know death right here, right now would be the
easier of the two.
You know I can’t, Peeta says, discarding the weapons.
Fine, I’ll go first anyway. He leans down and rips the bandage
off his leg, eliminating the final barrier between his
blood and the earth.
No, you can’t kill yourself, I say. I’m on my knees, desperately
plastering the bandage back onto his wound.
Katniss, he says. It’s what I want.
You’re not leaving me here alone, I say. Because if he dies,
I’ll never go home, not really. I’ll spend the rest of my life in
this arena trying to think my way out.
Listen, he says pulling me to my feet. We both know they
have to have a victor. It can only be one of us. Please, take it.
For me. And he goes on about how he loves me, what life
would be without me but I’ve stopped listening because his
previous words are trapped in my head, thrashing desperately
around.
We both know they have to have a victor.
Yes, they have to have a victor. Without a victor, the whole
thing would blow up in the Gamemakers’ faces. They’d have
failed the Capitol. Might possibly even be executed, slowly and
painfully while the cameras broadcast it to every screen in the
country.
If Peeta and I were both to die, or they thought we were . . .
339
My fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt, freeing it.
Peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist. No, I won’t let
you.
Trust me, I whisper. He holds my gaze for a long moment
then lets me go. I loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few
spoonfuls of berries into his palm. Then I fill my own. On the
count of three?
Peeta leans down and kisses me once, very gently. The
count of three, he says.
We stand, our backs pressed together, our empty hands
locked tight.
Hold them out. I want everyone to see, he says.
I spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten in the
sun. I give Peeta’s hand one last squeeze as a signal, as a goodbye,
and we begin counting. One. Maybe I’m wrong. Two.
Maybe they don’t care if we both die. Three! It’s too late to
change my mind. I lift my hand to my mouth, taking one last
look at the world. The berries have just passed my lips when
the trumpets begin to blare.
The frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts above
them. Stop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to
present the victors of the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games, Katniss
Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! I give you — the tributes of
District Twelve!
340
I spew the berries from my mouth, wiping my tongue with
the end of my shirt to make sure no juice remains. Peeta pulls
me to the lake where we both flush our mouths with water
and then collapse into each other’s arms.
You didn’t swallow any? I ask him.
He shakes his head. You?
Guess I’d be dead by now if I did, I say. I can see his lips
moving in reply, but I can’t hear him over the roar of the
crowd in the Capitol that they’re playing live over the speakers.
The hovercraft materializes overhead and two ladders
drop, only there’s no way I’m letting go of Peeta. I keep one
arm around him as I help him up, and we each place a foot on
the first rung of the ladder. The electric current freezes us in
place, and this time I’m glad because I’m not really sure Peeta
can hang on for the whole ride. And since my eyes were looking
down, I can see that while our muscles are immobile, nothing
is preventing the blood from draining out of Peeta’s leg.
Sure enough, the minute the door closes behind us and the
current stops, he slumps to the floor unconscious.
My fingers are still gripping the back of his jacket so tightly
that when they take him away it tears leaving me with a fistful
341
of black fabric. Doctors in sterile white, masked and gloved,
already prepped to operate, go into action. Peeta’s so pale and
still on a silver table, tubes and wires springing out of him
every which way, and for a moment I forget we’re out of the
Games and I see the doctors as just one more threat, one more
pack of mutts designed to kill him. Petrified, I lunge for him,
but I’m caught and thrust back into another room, and a glass
door seals between us. I pound on the glass, screaming my
head off. Everyone ignores me except for some Capitol attendant
who appears behind me and offers me a beverage.
I slump down on the floor, my face against the door, staring
uncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my hand. Icy cold,
filled with orange juice, a straw with a frilly white collar. How
wrong it looks in my bloody, filthy hand with its dirt-caked
nails and scars. My mouth waters at the smell, but I place it
carefully on the floor, not trusting anything so clean and pretty.
Through the glass, I see the doctors working feverishly on
Peeta, their brows creased in concentration. I see the flow of
liquids, pumping through the tubes, watch a wall of dials and
lights that mean nothing to me. I’m not sure, but I think his
heart stops twice.
It’s like being home again, when they bring in the hopelessly
mangled person from the mine explosion, or the woman in
her third day of labor, or the famished child struggling against
pneumonia and my mother and Prim, they wear that same
look on their faces. Now is the time to run away to the woods,
to hide in the trees until the patient is long gone and in anoth-
342
er part of the Seam the hammers make the coffin. But I’m held
here both by the hovercraft walls and the same force that
holds the loved ones of the dying. How often I’ve seen them,
ringed around our kitchen table and I thought, Why don’t they
leave? Why do they stay to watch?
And now I know. It’s because you have no choice.
I startle when I catch someone staring at me from only a
few inches away and then realize it’s my own face reflecting
back in the glass. Wild eyes, hollow cheeks, my hair in a tangled
mat. Rabid. Feral. Mad. No wonder everyone is keeping a
safe distance from me.
The next thing I know we’ve landed back on the roof of the
Training Center and they’re taking Peeta but leaving me behind
the door. I start hurling myself against the glass, shrieking
and I think I just catch a glimpse of pink hair — it must be
Effie, it has to be Effie coming to my rescue — when the
needle jabs me from behind.
When I wake, I’m afraid to move at first. The entire ceiling
glows with a soft yellow light allowing me to see that I’m in a
room containing just my bed. No doors, no windows are visible.
The air smells of something sharp and antiseptic. My right
arm has several tubes that extend into the wall behind me. I’m
naked, but the bedclothes arc soothing against my skin. I tentatively
lift my left hand above the cover. Not only has it been
scrubbed clean, the nails are filed in perfect ovals, the scars
from the burns are less prominent. I touch my cheek, my lips,
the puckered scar above my eyebrow, and am just running my
fingers through my silken hair when I freeze. Apprehensively I
343
ruffle the hair by my left ear. No, it wasn’t an illusion. I can
hear again.
I try and sit up, but some sort of wide restraining band
around my waist keeps me from rising more than a few inches.
The physical confinement makes me panic and I’m trying
to pull myself up and wriggle my hips through the band when
a portion of the wall slides open and in steps the redheaded
Avox girl carrying a tray. The sight of her calms me and I stop
trying to escape. I want to ask her a million questions, but I’m
afraid any familiarity would cause her harm. Obviously I am
being closely monitored. She sets the tray across my thighs
and presses something that raises me to a sitting position.
While she adjusts my pillows, I risk one question. I say it out
loud, as clearly as my rusty voice will allow, so nothing will
seem secretive. Did Peeta make it? She gives me a nod, and
as she slips a spoon into my hand, I feel the pressure of friendship.
I guess she did not wish me dead after all. And Peeta has
made it. Of course, he did. With all their expensive equipment
here. Still, I hadn’t been sure until now.
As the Avox leaves, the door closes noiselessly after her and
I turn hungrily to the tray. A bowl of clear broth, a small serving
of applesauce, and a glass of water. This is it? I think grouchily.
Shouldn’t my homecoming dinner be a little more spectacular?
But I find it’s an effort to finish the spare meal before
me. My stomach seems to have shrunk to the size of a chestnut,
and I have to wonder how long I’ve been out because I
had no trouble eating a fairly sizable breakfast that last morn-
344
ing in the arena. There’s usually a lag of a few days between
the end of the competition and the presentation of the victor
so that they can put the starving, wounded, mess of a person
back together again. Somewhere, Cinna and Portia will be
creating our wardrobes for the public appearances. Haymitch
and Effie will be arranging the banquet for our sponsors, reviewing
the questions for our final interviews. Back home,
District 12 is probably in chaos as they try and organize the
homecoming celebrations for Peeta and me, given that the last
one was close to thirty years ago.
Home! Prim and my mother! Gale! Even the thought of
Prim’s scruffy old cat makes me smile. Soon I will be home!
I want to get out of this bed. To see Peeta and Cinna, to find
out more about what’s been going on. And why shouldn’t I? I
feel fine. But as I start to work my way out of the band, I feel a
cold liquid seeping into my vein from one of the tubes and almost
immediately lose consciousness.
This happens on and off for an indeterminate amount of
time. My waking, eating, and, even though I resist the impulse
to try and escape the bed, being knocked out again. I seem to
be in a strange, continual twilight. Only a few things register.
The redheaded Avox girl has not returned since the feeding,
my scars are disappearing, and do I imagine it? Or do I hear a
man’s voice yelling? Not in the Capitol accent, but in the
rougher cadences of home. And I can’t help having a vague,
comforting feeling that someone is looking out for me.
Then finally, the time arrives when I come to and there’s
nothing plugged into my right arm. The restraint around my
345
middle has been removed and I am free to move about. I start
to sit up but am arrested by the sight of my hands. The skin’s
perfection, smooth and glowing. Not only are the scars from
the arena gone, but those accumulated over years of hunting
have vanished without a trace. My forehead feels like satin,
and when I try to find the burn on my calf, there’s nothing.
I slip my legs out of bed, nervous about how they will bear
my weight and find them strong and steady. Lying at the foot
of the bed is an outfit that makes me flinch. It’s what all of us
tributes wore in the arena. I stare at it as if it had teeth until I
remember that, of course, this is what I will wear to greet my
team.
I’m dressed in less than a minute and fidgeting in front of
the wall where I know there’s a door even if I can’t see it when
suddenly it slides open. I step into a wide, deserted hall that
appears to have no other doors on it. But it must. And behind
one of them must be Peeta. Now that I’m conscious and moving,
I’m growing more and more anxious about him. He must
be all right or the Avox girl wouldn’t have said so. But I need
to see him for myself.
Peeta! I call out, since there’s no one to ask. I hear my
name in response, but it’s not his voice. It’s a voice that provokes
first irritation and then eagerness. Effie.
I turn and see them all waiting in a big chamber at the end
of the hall — Effie, Haymitch, and Cinna. My feet take off without
hesitation. Maybe a victor should show more restraint,
more superiority, especially when she knows this will be on
tape, but I don’t care. I run for them and surprise even myself
346
when I launch into Haymitch’s arms first. When he whispers
in my ear, Nice job, sweetheart, it doesn’t sound sarcastic.
Effie’s somewhat teary and keeps patting my hair and talking
about how she told everyone we were pearls. Cinna just hugs
me tight and doesn’t say anything. Then I notice Portia is absent
and get a bad feeling.
Where’s Portia? Is she with Peeta? He is all right, isn’t he? I
mean, he’s alive? I blurt out.
He’s fine. Only they want to do your reunion live on air at
the ceremony, says Haymitch.
Oh. That’s all, I say. The awful moment of thinking Peeta’s
dead again passes. I guess I’d want to see that myself.
Go on with Cinna. He has to get you ready, says Haymitch.
It’s a relief to be alone with Cinna, to feel his protective arm
around my shoulders as he guides me away from the cameras,
down a few passages and to an elevator that leads to the lobby
of the Training Center. The hospital then is far underground,
even beneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying
knots and throwing spears. The windows of the lobby are
darkened, and a handful of guards stand on duty. No one else
is there to see us cross to the tribute elevator. Our footsteps
echo in the emptiness. And when we ride up to the twelfth
floor, the faces of all the tributes who will never return flash
across my mind and there’s a heavy, tight place in my chest.
When the elevator doors open, Venia, Flavius, and Octavia
engulf me, talking so quickly and ecstatically I can’t make out
their words. The sentiment is clear though. They are truly
thrilled to see me and I’m happy to see them, too, although not
347
like I was to see Cinna. It’s more in the way one might be glad
to see an affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly
difficult day.
They sweep me into the dining room and I get a real meal
— roast beef and peas and soft rolls — although my portions
are still being strictly controlled. Because when I ask for
seconds, I’m refused.
No, no, no. They don’t want it all coming back up on the
stage, says Octavia, but she secretly slips me an extra roll under
the table to let me know she’s on my side.
We go back to my room and Cinna disappears for a while as
the prep team gets me ready.
Oh, they did a full body polish on you, says Flavius enviously.
Not a flaw left on your skin.
But when I look at my naked body in the mirror, all I can
see is how skinny I am. I mean, I’m sure I was worse when I
came out of the arena, but I can easily count my ribs.
They take care of the shower settings for me, and they go to
work on my hair, nails, and makeup when I’m done. They
chatter so continuously that I barely have to reply, which is
good, since I don’t feel very talkative. It’s funny, because even
though they’re rattling on about the Games, it’s all about
where they were or what they were doing or how they felt
when a specific event occurred. I was still in bed! I had just
had my eyebrows dyed! I swear I nearly fainted! Everything
is about them, not the dying boys and girls in the arena.
We don’t wallow around in the Games this way in District
12. We grit our teeth and watch because we must and try to
348
get back to business as soon as possible when they’re over. To
keep from hating the prep team, I effectively tune out most of
what they’re saying.
Cinna comes in with what appears to be an unassuming yellow
dress across his arms.
Have you given up the whole ‘girl on fire’ thing? I ask.
You tell me, he says, and slips it over my head. I immediately
notice the padding over my breasts, adding curves that
hunger has stolen from my body. My hands go to my chest and
I frown.
I know, says Cinna before I can object. But the Gamemakers
wanted to alter you surgically. Haymitch had a huge
fight with them over it. This was the compromise. He stops
me before I can look at my reflection. Wait, don’t forget the
shoes. Venia helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and I
turn to the mirror.
I am still the girl on fire. The sheer fabric softly glows.
Even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my
body. By comparison, the chariot costume seems garish, the
interview dress too contrived. In this dress, I give the illusion
of wearing candlelight.
What do you think? asks Cinna.
I think it’s the best yet, I say. When I manage to pull my
eyes away from the flickering fabric, I’m in for something of a
shock. My hair’s loose, held back by a simple hairband. The
makeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face. A
clear polish coats my nails. The sleeveless dress is gathered at
my ribs, not my waist, largely eliminating any help the pad-
349
ding would have given my figure. The hem falls just to my
knees. Without heels, you can see my true stature. I look, very
simply, like a girl. A young one. Fourteen at the most. Innocent.
Harmless. Yes, it is shocking that Cinna has pulled this off
when you remember I’ve just won the Games.
This is a very calculated look. Nothing Cinna designs is arbitrary.
I bite my lip trying to figure out his motivation.
I thought it’d be something more . . . sophisticatedlooking,
I say.
I thought Peeta would like this better, he answers carefully.
Peeta? No, it’s not about Peeta. It’s about the Capitol and
the Gamemakers and the audience. Although I do not yet understand
Cinna’s design, it’s a reminder the Games are not
quite finished. And beneath his benign reply, I sense a warning.
Of something he can’t even mention in front of his own
team.
We take the elevator to the level where we trained. It’s customary
for the victor and his or her support team to rise from
beneath the stage. First the prep team, followed by the escort,
the stylist, the mentor, and finally the victor. Only this year,
with two victors who share both an escort and a mentor, the
whole thing has had to be rethought. I find myself in a poorly
lit area under the stage. A brand-new metal plate has been installed
to transport me upward. You can still see small piles of
sawdust, smell fresh paint. Cinna and the prep team peel off to
change into their own costumes and take their positions, leav-
350
ing me alone. In the gloom, I see a makeshift wall about ten
yards away and assume Peeta’s behind it.
The rumbling of the crowd is loud, so I don’t notice Haymitch
until he touches my shoulder. I spring away, startled,
still half in the arena, I guess.
Easy, just me. Let’s have a look at you, Haymitch says. I
hold out my arms and turn once. Good enough.
It’s not much of a compliment. But what? I say.
Haymitch’s eyes shift around my musty holding space, and
he seems to make a decision. But nothing. How about a hug
for luck?
Okay, that’s an odd request from Haymitch but, after all, we
are victors. Maybe a hug for luck is in order. Only, when I put
my arms around his neck, I find myself trapped in his embrace.
He begins talking, very fast, very quietly in my ear, my
hair concealing his lips.
Listen up. You’re in trouble. Word is the Capitol’s furious
about you showing them up in the arena. The one thing they
can’t stand is being laughed at and they’re the joke of Panem,
says Haymitch.
I feel dread coursing through me now, but I laugh as though
Haymitch is saying something completely delightful because
nothing is covering my mouth. So, what?
Your only defense can be you were so madly in love you
weren’t responsible for your actions. Haymitch pulls back
and adjusts my hairband. Got it, sweetheart? He could be
talking about anything now.
Got it, I say. Did you tell Peeta this?
351
Don’t have to, says Haymitch. He’s already there.
But you think I’m not? I say, taking the opportunity to
straighten a bright red bow tie Cinna must have wrestled him
into.
Since when does it matter what I think? says Haymitch.
Better take our places. He leads me to the metal circle. This
is your night, sweetheart. Enjoy it. He kisses me on the forehead
and disappears into the gloom.
I tug on my skirt, willing it to be longer, wanting it to cover
the knocking in my knees. Then I realize it’s pointless. My
whole body’s shaking like a leaf. Hopefully, it will be put down
to excitement. After all, it’s my night.
The damp, moldy smell beneath the stage threatens to
choke me. A cold, clammy sweat breaks out on my skin and I
can’t rid myself of the feeling that the boards above my head
are about to collapse, to bury me alive under the rubble. When
I left the arena, when the trumpets played, I was supposed to
be safe. From then on. For the rest of my life. But if what Haymitch
says is true, and he’s got no reason to lie, I’ve never
been in such a dangerous place in my life.
It’s so much worse than being hunted in the arena. There, I
could only die. End of story. But out here Prim, my mother,
Gale, the people of District 12, everyone I care about back
home could be punished if I can’t pull off the girl-drivencrazy-by-love
scenario Haymitch has suggested.
So I still have a chance, though. Funny, in the arena, when I
poured out those berries, I was only thinking of outsmarting
the Gamemakers, not how my actions would reflect on the Ca-
352
pitol. But the Hunger Games are their weapon and you are not
supposed to be able to defeat it. So now the Capitol will act as
if they’ve been in control the whole time. As if they orchestrated
the whole event, right down to the double suicide. But
that will only work if I play along with them.
And Peeta . . . Peeta will suffer, too, if this goes wrong. But
what was it Haymitch said when I asked if he had told Peeta
the situation? That he had to pretend to be desperately in
love?
Don’t have to. He’s already there.
Already thinking ahead of me in the Games again and well
aware of the danger we’re in? Or . . . already desperately in
love? I don’t know. I haven’t even begun to separate out my
feelings about Peeta. It’s too complicated. What I did as part of
the Games. As opposed to what I did out of anger at the Capitol.
Or because of how it would be viewed back in District 12.
Or simply because it was the only decent thing to do. Or what I
did because I cared about him.
These are questions to be unraveled back home, in the
peace and quiet of the woods, when no one is watching. Not
here with every eye upon me. But I won’t have that luxury for
who knows how long. And right now, the most dangerous part
of the Hunger Games is about to begin.
353
The anthem booms in my ears, and then I hear Caesar
Flickerman greeting the audience. Does he know how crucial
it is to get every word right from now on? He must. He will
want to help us. The crowd breaks into applause as the prep
teams are presented. I imagine Flavius, Venia, and Octavia
bouncing around and taking ridiculous, bobbing bows. It’s a
safe bet they’re clueless. Then Effie’s introduced. How long
she’s waited for this moment. I hope she’s able to enjoy it because
as misguided as Effie can be, she has a very keen instinct
about certain things and must at least suspect we’re in
trouble. Portia and Cinna receive huge cheers, of course,
they’ve been brilliant, had a dazzling debut. I now understand
Cinna’s choice of dress for me for tonight. I’ll need to look as
girlish and innocent as possible. Haymitch’s appearance
brings a round of stomping that goes on at least five minutes.
Well, he’s accomplished a first. Keeping not only one but two
tributes alive. What if he hadn’t warned me in time? Would I
have acted differently? Flaunted the moment with the berries
in the Capitol’s face? No, I don’t think so. But I could easily
have been a lot less convincing than I need to be now. Right
now. Because I can feel the plate lifting me up to the stage.
354
Blinding lights. The deafening roar rattles the metal under
my feet. Then there’s Peeta just a few yards away. He looks so
clean and healthy and beautiful, I can hardly recognize him.
But his smile is the same whether in mud or in the Capitol and
when I see it, I take about three steps and fling myself into his
arms. He staggers back, almost losing his balance, and that’s
when I realize the slim, metal contraption in his hand is some
kind of cane. He rights himself and we just cling to each other
while the audience goes insane. He’s kissing me and all the
time I’m thinking, Do you know? Do you know how much danger
we’re in? After about ten minutes of this, Caesar Flickerman
taps on his shoulder to continue the show, and Peeta just
pushes him aside without even glancing at him. The audience
goes berserk. Whether he knows or not, Peeta is, as usual,
playing the crowd exactly right.
Finally, Haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good-natured
shove toward the victor’s chair. Usually, this is a single, ornate
chair from which the winning tribute watches a film of the
highlights of the Games, but since there are two of us, the Gamemakers
have provided a plush red velvet couch. A small
one, my mother would call it a love seat, I think. I sit so close
to Peeta that I’m practically on his lap, but one look from
Haymitch tells me it isn’t enough. Kicking off my sandals, I
tuck my feet to the side and lean my head against Peeta’s
shoulder. His arm goes around me automatically, and I feel
like I’m back in the cave, curled up against him, trying to keep
warm. His shirt is made of the same yellow material as my
dress, but Portia’s put him in long black pants. No sandals, ei-
355
ther, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted
on the stage. I wish Cinna had given me a similar outfit, I feel
so vulnerable in this flimsy dress. But I guess that was the
point.
Caesar Flickerman makes a few more jokes, and then it’s
time for the show. This will last exactly three hours and is required
viewing for all of Panem. As the lights dim and the seal
appears on the screen, I realize I’m unprepared for this. I do
not want to watch my twenty-two fellow tributes die. I saw
enough of them die the first time. My heart starts pounding
and I have a strong impulse to run. How have the other victors
faced this alone? During the highlights, they periodically show
the winner’s reaction up on a box in the corner of the screen. I
think back to earlier years . . . some are triumphant, pumping
their fists in the air, beating their chests. Most just seem
stunned. All I know is that the only thing keeping me on this
love seat is Peeta — his arm around my shoulder, his other
hand claimed by both of mine. Of course, the previous victors
didn’t have the Capitol looking for a way to destroy them.
Condensing several weeks into three hours is quite a feat,
especially when you consider how many cameras were going
at once. Whoever puts together the highlights has to choose
what sort of story to tell. This year, for the first time, they tell
a love story. I know Peeta and I won, but a disproportionate
amount of time is spent on us, right from the beginning. I’m
glad though, because it supports the whole crazy-in-love thing
that’s my defense for defying the Capitol, plus it means we
won’t have as much time to linger over the deaths.
356
The first half hour or so focuses on the pre-arena events,
the reaping, the chariot ride through the Capitol, our training
scores, and our interviews. There’s this sort of upbeat
soundtrack playing under it that makes it twice as awful because,
of course, almost everyone on-screen is dead.
Once we’re in the arena, there’s detailed coverage of the
bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically alternate between
shots of tributes dying and shots of us. Mostly Peeta really,
there’s no question he’s carrying this romance thing on
his shoulders. Now I see what the audience saw, how he
misled the Careers about me, stayed awake the entire night
under the tracker jacker tree, fought Cato to let me escape and
even while he lay in that mud bank, whispered my name in his
sleep. I seem heartless in comparison — dodging fireballs,
dropping nests, and blowing up supplies — until I go hunting
for Rue. They play her death in full, the spearing, my failed
rescue attempt, my arrow through the boy from District 1’s
throat, Rue drawing her last breath in my arms. And the song.
I get to sing every note of the song. Something inside me shuts
down and I’m too numb to feel anything. It’s like watching
complete strangers in another Hunger Games. But I do notice
they omit the part where I covered her in flowers.
Right. Because even that smacks of rebellion.
Things pick up for me once they’ve announced two tributes
from the same district can live and I shout out Peeta’s name
and then clap my hands over my mouth. If I’ve seemed indifferent
to him earlier, I make up for it now, by finding him, nursing
him back to health, going to the feast for the medicine, and
357
being very free with my kisses. Objectively, I can see the mutts
and Cato’s death are as gruesome as ever, but again, I feel it
happens to people I have never met.
And then comes the moment with the berries. I can hear
the audience hushing one another, not wanting to miss anything.
A wave of gratitude to the filmmakers sweeps over me
when they end not with the announcement of our victory, but
with me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, screaming
Peeta’s name as they try to revive him.
In terms of survival, it’s my best moment all night.
The anthem’s playing yet again and we rise as President
Snow himself takes the stage followed by a little girl carrying
a cushion that holds the crown. There’s just one crown,
though, and you can hear the crowd’s confusion — whose
head will he place it on? — until President Snow gives it a
twist and it separates into two halves. He places the first
around Peeta’s brow with a smile. He’s still smiling when he
settles the second on my head, but his eyes, just inches from
mine, are as unforgiving as a snake’s.
That’s when I know that even though both of us would have
eaten the berries, I am to blame for having the idea. I’m the instigator.
I’m the one to be punished.
Much bowing and cheering follows. My arm is about to fall
off from waving when Caesar Flickerman finally bids the audience
good night, reminding them to tune in tomorrow for
the final interviews. As if they have a choice.
Peeta and I are whisked to the president’s mansion for the
Victory Banquet, where we have very little time to eat as Capi-
358
tol officials and particularly generous sponsors elbow one
another out of the way as they try to get their picture with us.
Face after beaming face flashes by, becoming increasingly intoxicated
as the evening wears on. Occasionally, I catch a
glimpse of Haymitch, which is reassuring, or President Snow,
which is terrifying, but I keep laughing and thanking people
and smiling as my picture is taken. The one thing I never do is
let go of Peeta’s hand.
The sun is just peeking over the horizon when we straggle
back to the twelfth floor of the Training Center. I think now I’ll
finally get a word alone with Peeta, but Haymitch sends him
off with Portia to get something fitted for the interview and
personally escorts me to my door.
Why can’t I talk to him? I ask.
Plenty of time for talk when we get home, says Haymitch.
Go to bed, you’re on air at two.
Despite Haymitch’s running interference, I’m determined to
see Peeta privately. After I toss and turn for a few hours, I slip
into the hall. My first thought is to check the roof, but it’s empty.
Even the city streets far below are deserted after the celebration
last night. I go back to bed for a while and then decide
to go directly to his room, but when I try to turn the knob, I
find my own bedroom door has been locked from the outside.
I suspect Haymitch initially, but then there’s a more insidious
fear that the Capitol may by monitoring and confining me. I’ve
been unable to escape since the Hunger Games began, but this
feels different, much more personal. This feels like I’ve been
imprisoned for a crime and I’m awaiting sentencing. I quickly
359
get back in bed and pretend to sleep until Effie Trinket comes
to alert me to the start of another big, big, big day!
I have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain and
stew before the prep team descends. All I have to say is, The
crowd loved you! and it’s unnecessary to speak for the next
couple of hours. When Cinna comes in, he shoos them out and
dresses me in a white, gauzy dress and pink shoes. Then he
personally adjusts my makeup until I seem to radiate a soft,
rosy glow. We make idle chitchat, but I’m afraid to ask him
anything of real importance because after the incident with
the door, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched constantly.
The interview takes place right down the hall in the sitting
room. A space has been cleared and the love seat has been
moved in and surrounded by vases of red and pink roses.
There are only a handful of cameras to record the event. No
live audience at least.
Caesar Flickerman gives me a warm hug when I. come in.
Congratulations, Katniss. How are you faring?
Fine. Nervous about the interview, I say.
Don’t be. We’re going to have a fabulous time, he says,
giving my cheek a reassuring pat.
I’m not good at talking about myself, I say.
Nothing you say will be wrong, he says.
And I think, Oh, Caesar, if only that were true. But actually,
President Snow may be arranging some sort of accident for
me as we speak.
360
Then Peeta’s there looking handsome in red and white,
pulling me off to the side. I hardly get to see you. Haymitch
seems bent on keeping us apart.
Haymitch is actually bent on keeping us alive, but there are
too many ears listening, so I just say, Yes, he’s gotten very responsible
lately.
Well, there’s just this and we go home. Then he can’t watch
us all the time, says Peeta.
I feel a sort of shiver run through me and there’s no time to
analyze why, because they’re ready for us. We sit somewhat
formally on the love seat, but Caesar says, Oh, go ahead and
curl up next to him if you want. It looked very sweet. So I tuck
my feet up and Peeta pulls me in close to him.
Someone counts backward and just like that, we’re being
broadcast live to the entire country. Caesar Flickerman is
wonderful, teasing, joking, getting choked up when the occasion
presents itself. He and Peeta already have the rapport
they established that night of the first interview, that easy
banter, so I just smile a lot and try to speak as little as possible.
I mean, I have to talk some, but as soon as I can I redirect
the conversation back to Peeta.
Eventually though, Caesar begins to pose questions that insist
on fuller answers. Well, Peeta, we know, from our days in
the cave, that it was love at first sight for you from what, age
five? Caesar says.
From the moment I laid eyes on her, says Peeta.
361
But, Katniss, what a ride for you. I think the real excitement
for the audience was watching you fall for him. When
did you realize you were in love with him? asks Caesar.
Oh, that’s a hard one . . . I give a faint, breathy laugh and
look down at my hands. Help.
Well, I know when it hit me. The night when you shouted
out his name from that tree, says Caesar.
Thank you, Caesar! I think, and then go with his idea. Yes, I
guess that was it. I mean, until that point, I just tried not to
think about what my feelings might be, honestly, because it
was so confusing and it only made things worse if I actually
cared about him. But then, in the tree, everything changed, I
say.
Why do you think that was? urges Caesar.
Maybe . . . because for the first time . . . there was a chance
I could keep him, I say.
Behind a cameraman, I see Haymitch give a sort of huff
with relief and I know I’ve said the right thing. Caesar pulls
out a handkerchief and has to take a moment because he’s so
moved. I can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and
he asks, So now that you’ve got me, what are you going to do
with me?
I turn in to him. Put you somewhere you can’t get hurt.
And when he kisses me, people in the room actually sigh.
For Caesar, this is a natural place to segue into all the ways
we did get hurt in the arena, from burns, to stings, to wounds.
But it’s not until we get around to the mutts that I forget I’m
362
on camera. When Caesar asks Peeta how his new leg is
working out.
New leg? I say, and I can’t help reaching out and pulling
up the bottom of Peeta’s pants. Oh, no, I whisper, taking in
the metal-and-plastic device that has replaced his flesh.
No one told you? asks Caesar gently. I shake my head.
I haven’t had the chance, says Peeta with a slight shrug.
It’s my fault, I say. Because I used that tourniquet.
Yes, it’s your fault I’m alive, says Peeta.
He’s right, says Caesar. He’d have bled to death for sure
without it.
I guess this is true, but I can’t help feeling upset about it to
the extent that I’m afraid I might cry and then I remember
everyone in the country is watching me so I just bury my face
in Peeta’s shirt. It takes them a couple of minutes to coax me
back out because it’s better in the shirt, where no one can see
me, and when I do come out, Caesar backs off questioning me
so I can recover. In fact, he pretty much leaves me alone until
the berries come up.
Katniss, I know you’ve had a shock, but I’ve got to ask. The
moment when you pulled out those berries. What was going
on in your mind . . . hm? he says.
I take a long pause before I answer, trying to collect my
thoughts. This is the crucial moment where I either challenged
the Capitol or went so crazy at the idea of losing Peeta that I
can’t be held responsible for my actions. It seems to call for a
big, dramatic speech, but all I get out is one almost inaudible
sentence. I don’t know, I just . . . couldn’t bear the thought of .
. . being without him.
Peeta? Anything to add? asks Caesar.
No. I think that goes for both of us, he says.
Caesar signs off and it’s over. Everyone’s laughing and crying
and hugging, but I’m still not sure until I reach Haymitch.
Okay? I whisper.
Perfect, he answers.
I go back to my room to collect a few things and find there’s
nothing to take but the mockingjay pin Madge gave me. Someone
returned it to my room after the Games. They drive us
through the streets in a car with blackened windows, and the
train’s waiting for us. We barely have time to say good-bye to
Cinna and Portia, although we’ll see them in a few months,
when we tour the districts for a round of victory ceremonies.
It’s the Capitol’s way of reminding people that the Hunger
Games never really go away. We’ll be given a lot of useless
plaques, and everyone will have to pretend they love us.
The train begins moving and we’re plunged into night until
we clear the tunnel and I take my first free breath since the
reaping. Effie is accompanying us back and Haymitch, too, of
course. We eat an enormous dinner and settle into silence in
front of the television to watch a replay of the interview. With
the Capitol growing farther away every second, I begin to
think of home. Of Prim and my mother. Of Gale. I excuse myself
to change out of my dress and into a plain shirt and pants.
As I slowly, thoroughly wash the makeup from my face and
put my hair in its braid, I begin transforming back into myself.
Katniss Everdeen. A girl who lives in the Seam. Hunts in the
woods. Trades in the Hob. I stare in the mirror as I try to remember
who I am and who I am not. By the time I join the
others, the pressure of Peeta’s arm around my shoulders feels
alien.
When the train makes a brief stop for fuel, we’re allowed to
go outside for some fresh air. There’s no longer any need to
guard us. Peeta and I walk down along the track, hand in hand,
and I can’t find anything to say now that we’re alone. He stops
to gather a bunch of wildflowers for me. When he presents
them, I work hard to look pleased. Because he can’t know that
the pink-and-white flowers are the tops of wild onions and
only remind me of the hours I’ve spent gathering them with
Gale.
Gale. The idea of seeing Gale in a matter of hours makes my
stomach churn. But why? I can’t quite frame it in my mind. I
only know that I feel like I’ve been lying to someone who
trusts me. Or more accurately, to two people. I’ve been getting
away with it up to this point because of the Games. But there
will be no Games to hide behind back home.
What’s wrong? Peeta asks.
Nothing, I answer. We continue walking, past the end of
the train, out where even I’m fairly sure there are no cameras
hidden in the scrubby bushes along the track. Still no words
come.
Haymitch startles me when he lays a hand on my back.
Even now, in the middle of nowhere, he keeps his voice down.
Great job, you two. Just keep it up in the district until the
cameras are gone. We should be okay. I watch him head back
to the train, avoiding Peeta’s eyes.
What’s he mean? Peeta asks me.
It’s the Capitol. They didn’t like our stunt with the berries,
I blurt out.
What? What are you talking about? he says.
It seemed too rebellious. So, Haymitch has been coaching
me through the last few days. So I didn’t make it worse, I say.
Coaching you? But not me, says Peeta.
He knew you were smart enough to get it right, I say.
I didn’t know there was anything to get right, says Peeta.
So, what you’re saying is, these last few days and then I guess
. . . back in the arena . . . that was just some strategy you two
worked out.
No. I mean, I couldn’t even talk to him in the arena, could
I? I stammer.
But you knew what he wanted you to do, didn’t you? says
Peeta. I bite my lip. Katniss? He drops my hand and I take a
step, as if to catch my balance.
It was all for the Games, Peeta says. How you acted.
Not all of it, I say, tightly holding onto my flowers.
Then how much? No, forget that. I guess the real question
is what’s going to be left when we get home? he says.
I don’t know. The closer we get to District Twelve, the
more confused I get, I say. He waits, for further explanation,
but none’s forthcoming.
Well, let me know when you work it out, he says, and the
pain in his voice is palpable.
I know my ears are healed because, even with the rumble
of the engine, I can hear every step he takes back to the train.
By the time I’ve climbed aboard, Peeta has disappeared into
his room for the night. I don’t see him the next morning, either.
In fact, the next time he turns up, we’re pulling into District
12. He gives me a nod, his face expressionless.
I want to tell him that he’s not being fair. That we were
strangers. That I did what it took to stay alive, to keep us both
alive in the arena. That I can’t explain how things are with
Gale because I don’t know myself. That it’s no good loving me
because I’m never going to get married anyway and he’d just
end up hating me later instead of sooner. That if I do have feelings
for him, it doesn’t matter because I’ll never be able to afford
the kind of love that leads to a family, to children. And
how can he? How can he after what we’ve just been through?
I also want to tell him how much I already miss him. But
that wouldn’t be fair on my part.
So we just stand there silently, watching our grimy little
station rise up around us. Through the window, I can see the
platform’s thick with cameras. Everyone will be eagerly
watching our homecoming.
Out of the corner of my eye, I see Peeta extend his hand. I
look at him, unsure. One more time? For the audience? he
says. His voice isn’t angry. It’s hollow, which is worse. Already
the boy with the bread is slipping away from me.
I take his hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the cameras,
and dreading the moment when I will finally have to let
go.
