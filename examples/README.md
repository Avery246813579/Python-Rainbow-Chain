# Rainbow Chain Example

The best example I have is a project generating Unique Obama Quotes named
[Obama Speech Quote Generator](https://github.com/Avery246813579/Obama-Speech-Quote-Generator)!

## First Order
The first order Rainbow Chain is best used when you have a small corpus.
I suggest using a first order for a book or a season of a tv show.
Because we are only using a first order Rainbow Chain our grammar will
be pretty bad but going to a second order will cause less unique
sentences (we will get sentences right from the corpus).

In [my example](FirstOrder) I use the first hunger games to generate
unique and seeded quotes.

## Second Order
The second order Rainbow Chain is best used when you have a medium sized
corpus. I suggest using a second order for series of books or tv shows.
Now that we have a second order we have more grammatical sentences with
more uniqueness.

In [my example](SecondOrder) I use all the hunger games books to
generate unique and seeded quotes.

## Third Order and Higher
